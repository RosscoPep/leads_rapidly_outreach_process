Here are just a few amazing projects that have come to life in recent months:

🌀 Fellow Heather Knight has co-developed TENDING TO ENDINGS, a card deck for reimagining our relationship to endings. Drawing on the garden as a metaphor, this deck offers imaginative yet grounded ways to navigate difficult terrain. Learn more at https://lnkd.in/eTfPTRZi

🪶 Fellows Rachel Musson and Holly Everett have continued to develop their Triple WellBeing framework through their organisation, ThoughtBox Education. They are now offering several practitioner and leadership courses to bring the framework to educators across the UK and beyond. Learn more at https://lnkd.in/eEb-wjQ8

🌾 Fellow Gina Maffey has launched The Reeding Room, a monthly online book club in dialogue with the natural world. Each month features a book or a theme, and there is a monthly Zoom call, sometimes with special guests, to discuss the topic at hand. Learn more and join here: https://lnkd.in/ewrEErBP

And finally, here’s a brilliant list of podcasts created and hosted by Bio-Leadership Fellows!
🎧 A Thriving Future hosted by Hannah Temple
🎧 Brackish hosted by Katie Treggiden
🎧 Coconut Thinking hosted by Benjamin Freud, Ph.D.
🎧 Two Inconvenient Women hosted by Rachel Musson and Holly Everett
🎧 Circle of Voices by Louise Romain

Just yesterday we held a session in the Bio-Leadership Fellowship on Facing Uncertainty and Building Resilience. One of our guests, the brilliant Andy Middleton, shared how the risks that are coming to the world are equivalent to a category 5 or 6 white water rafting event - the most severely difficult and challenging types of water to navigate. But much of society is still thinking about them as category 1 or 2 risks. 

Are we having a big enough conversation about preparation for risks and building resilience? 

Yesterday the US stopped funding a body that assesses climate risks. What form of thinking stops the alarm and intelligence systems on severe risks to a whole society?: https://lnkd.in/e5kyi_qr 

We continue our module on resilience today - working on how natural systems stay resilient, then going deeper into how to stay personally resilient in tough times. 

More recently I’ve been doing more work on resilience, including workshops with Patagonia in Europe, on resilience and integrity. 

I’d love to help more people connect with these themes if they are of interest. I very much plan to stay connected with Andy and others on how to support more conversations and actions on resilience closer to home. A huge inspiration from Andy - let’s not be afraid to be honest about what’s needed and frame big intentions about what we can do. 

Watch this space and do please reach out if resilience is something on your mind.

The concept comes from the Netherlands and has been brought across to try and improve cycle facilities in the UK. The completed scheme should actually not have a significant impact on traffic.""

The team are looking forward to the awards ceremony in Venice in May.
 
Proudly British, FOX hails from the drawing boards of Q London, with Pendennis responsible for her engineering and construction. Fox’s striking exterior design is muscular and practical in appearance, and her beach-house style interiors are bright and modern.
 
Key to her design is the 103.5sqm (1,114sqft) main deck aft, which enables her to carry a huge range of equipment, from water toys and two 7.5m (24.6ft) tenders to amphibious vehicles and submersibles, launched by two 2.5T SWL deck cranes - carrying capacity usually unheard of in a yacht of this size. FOX’s main aft deck has endless possibilities for relaxation and entertainment, she’s a true explorer yacht of Northern European quality.
 
Catch FOX at the Palm Beach International Boat Show, where she will be exhibiting with her central agents Burgess in the Palm Harbor Marina. FOX’s berth location will be E111. A team from Pendennis will be in Palm Beach onboard. 

Contact info@pendennis.com to arrange an appointment to view FOX.

We have made a concerted effort over the last few years to try and do some more wholesome events that weren’t just booze fuelled.

We had a treasure hunt in spring and this was our summer social, a sports day organised brilliantly by Phil Boshier (who is on point for internal hiring BTW).

Succession = Progress = Growth = Opportunity

Too often people use this word to only talk about Director or Shareholder levels in business but it is so much more.

As we have grown mustard | B Corp™ we’ve worked super hard to work on succession planning at all levels through the business. We encourage and want everyone thinking about how they can scale and add to their part of the business and ultimately move to their next role, pulling people up behind them.

Whether its Talent Partner to Mentor/Lead Consultant, Senior Consultant to Team Leader, Or Associate Director to Director Level. If you have a growth mindset, are selfless with your time and ultimately mentor the next you to come through, you will be going along way to create the opportunity for your next role.

We’ve had some big moves across our team over the last 6 months and there will be more to come…..

So…if you are 3 to 12 months into recruitment, love the industry but your day to day is battling for attention in a toxic environment like an episode of Succession…. Drop our internal recruitment legend a line Imogen Shelley… we’d love to hear from you!

First we had Nicks OBE trip then Dr. Paul Stewart tour of Poland to tell everyone about. But now seems perfect - as it should be for Nick Gazzard OBE who is one of the best guys and a fantastic personal friend & support to us all. 

We are honoured to welcome Nick Gazzard OBE as a Safeguarding Fundamentals Ambassador.

Nick’s unwavering commitment to safeguarding and violence prevention has profoundly impacted countless lives. As the founder of the Hollie Gazzard Trust, established in memory of his daughter Hollie, Nick has dedicated himself to raising awareness about domestic abuse and stalking. The Trust’s initiatives, including educational workshops and the development of the Hollie Guard personal safety app, have empowered individuals and communities across the UK to recognise the signs of abuse and take proactive measures to stay safe .

Nick shared:

“It is an honour to become an Ambassador for Safeguarding Fundamentals. This initiative is a transformative step toward ensuring the safety and well-being of children across all organisations. Safeguarding Fundamentals embodies a commitment to creating environments where children are protected, respected, and given the opportunity to thrive. As someone deeply invested in creating a safer future, I believe this cause is not just worthwhile but essential. Every child needs to feel supported, valued, and safe.”

Having Nick join the #TeamSGF movement amplifies our collective voice. His lived experience, advocacy, and leadership are invaluable as we strive to change the culture of safeguarding.

Together, we can make safeguarding simpler, more human, and rooted in shared responsibility.

As a charity YOU control the majority of the fundraising process.  Followed by the funders.

The fundraisers have the least control over the process. 

📌 Because fundraisers match, coordinate and communicate what ALREADY exists.
 
Charities control ""what"" the funders fund - and funders control ""how, why and when"" they fund it.

𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆, 𝗳𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗿𝗮𝗶𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘀:

Match your charity with donors – based on your impact evidence.
↪️ weak to no impact evidence = poor matching.

Invite donors to join you in changing the world over the short and long term – based on your track record and your future ability to deliver change.
↪️ no real ability to change the world/compelling vision = unappealing invitation/ask.

Deliver a wonderful donor experience, so funders stick around and recommend you to other funders – based on your stewardship and relationship building opportunities.
↪️ Too few opportunities to deepen the relationship = too few reasons for donors to stick around.

𝗘𝘅𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗳𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗿𝗮𝗶𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘀:

Identify which donors already believe in your cause – based on their funding criteria or past activities.
↪️ Donors allow fundraisers in or keep them out = limited accessibility to networks limits identifying best fit donors.

Engage donors in conversation to determine interest, value of potential partnership and timing – based on the donors’ predetermined goals, budgets and timelines.
↪️ Donors determine the parameters = no alignment evidence, no detailed budgets or a need to rush the donation stops engagement before it can even start.

Asks for a donation when it is appropriate to do so - based on the donors’ timeline.
↪️ Donors have multiple timelines = having one timeline (money in by the end of the financial year) makes your fundraisers out of sync.

Steward the donors to deepen the relationship for long term funding – based on meeting their needs in proportion to the value of the donation given.
↪️ Donors judge the quality of their experience = not enjoying the relationship means there's no need to stick around or give again. 

Charities you need to be fundraising ready or willing to listen to fundraisers to make you so. 

Do you have:

✅ A compelling vision
✅ The ability to deliver (and evidence) how you change the world
✅ Access to funding networks to engage and invite funders to join you (if not see me) 😀
✅ Flexibility to fundraise in and out of this financial year 
✅ The ability to deepen donor relationships 

What you do have is:

I've frequently been told- 'they do nothing apart from going to meetings'. 

I've  been a CEO for over 20 years and served as a trustee and chair for several charities, so I've seen both sides. Part of the reason for this is that they're not asked and supported to help in the right way. 

What I've found really useful is to encourage my trustees to be external Ambassadors ('cos I can't be everywhere), to open up opportunities. So I thought I'd share some things I've learned that worked well.

1. Be clear - put the requirement to act as an external Ambassador in the trustee role description
2. Reframe - be clear that you're not asking them to fundraise (""it's not asking for cash""); instead they are influencing and sharing the passion for your cause.
3. Train them - on charity story-telling, elevator pitch, your theory of change and heart-warming case studies - keeping it personal
4. Tool them - give them your killer stats, no. of people helped, your outcome figures - so they're readily to hand to explain your impact - and encourage them to share these in their networks.
5. Support them ongoing - chat informally, agenda item at board meetings, celebrate successes, thank them in-person & newsletters.

Remember: Being visible creates trust. Trust creates opportunity. Opportunity opens doors.

Once a new opportunity has been opened, the follow-through is handled by the CEO, who keeps the trustees looped in.

I hope this helps - let me know if this has worked for you.",252,27,14,3w,Lisa Cousins MInstF (Dip) reposted this,Madeleine Cassidy,https://www.linkedin.com/in/madeleine-cassidy-84735221,,2025-04-13T09:23:34.065Z,,,

As results roll in across the UK, from regional mayors to local councillors, what's clear is our political landscape is evolving. 

Whether or not you agree with the new options, having more choice is good for democracy. It keeps established parties active and alert, and gives voters more say in shaping the future they want to see. 

The Runcorn by-election, where just four votes separate the top two candidates leading to a recount is a powerful reminder: every vote really does count and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.

But they turned out to be the best hires. 

I have interviewed over 5,000 candidates.
And I can tell you that most skills can be taught. 

The best hires come from different places. 
And, they don't always have the best resumes. 

These things are more important than experience:

✅ Curiosity to keep learning
✅ Drive to go above and beyond
✅ Adaptability to grow with the role
✅ Collaboration to work well with others
✅ Empathy to understand and connect with others 
✅ Accountability to take ownership and follow through
✅ Self-motivation to stay proactive and get things done 
✅ Creativity to bring fresh ideas and solutions to the table
✅ Integrity to do the right thing, even when no one’s watching
✅ Resilience to handle challenges and setbacks with a positive attitude

These qualities aren’t always visible on paper.
But they make all the difference once hired.

When hiring, remember that skills can be trained. 
But values and attitudes can’t.

Do you agree?

They join five other creative students from institutions across the UK as 2025 recipients (pictured), who will continue the legacy of the Foundation's namesake George, a promising young performer sadly passed away after a diagnosis of oesophageal cancer during his musical theatre training.

The Foundation's support has enabled Bessy to undertake specific projects during her final year of training, while Callum prepares to enter the industry with added confidence. We're proud to see our students benefit from this Foundation for a second year, helping promising artists overcome financial barriers to pursuing their chosen careers. 💙👏

Diejenigen, die einen geliebten Menschen verloren haben, vermissen ihn zutiefst, während andere, die ihn in der Nähe haben, sich oft über ihn beschweren. Wer keinen Partner hat, sehnt sich danach, aber wer einen hat, schätzt sie manchmal nicht. Wer Hunger hat, würde alles für einen Teller Essen geben, während wer genug hat, sich über den Geschmack beschwert. Wer kein Auto hat, träumt davon, während wer es hat, immer ein besseres sucht. Der Schlüssel ist, dankbar zu sein, innezuhalten, um zu sehen, was wir besitzen und zu verstehen, dass irgendwo jemand alles geben würde, was du bereits hast und nicht zu schätzen weißt.""🥹🌹

One of the toughest challenges I face day-to-day is staying on top of tasks, especially as someone whose mind races a mile a minute with new ideas and as I attempt to juggle many tasks at a time.

This has become even more important now I am growing a team, as I realise the wonderful Fanny Salmon is not a mind reader and also cannot keep up with the thoughts and ideas that are in my head.

Balancing my health and managing projects has been a journey, to say the least. That's why finding efficient processes for Fanny Salmon to seamlessly continue working when I'm unwell, and exploring better ways to approve content, has become essential.

Notion has been a game-changer, gone are the days of hundreds of back and fourths via whatsapp at all hours.

We now have our Human Beauty Hub which keeps everything in one accessible place. I can now approve content on the go and write down all my ideas when I have them without having to disturb anyone in the middle of the night (if i don't write it down when it comes, the idea is gone forever!).

If anyone else can relate to these struggles, I can't recommend Notion enough. If you'd like to give it a try, use the link below to apply for 6 months free access, including unlimited use of their AI.

https://lnkd.in/eBTef4bg

Now, I just need to look at other ways to start organising my brain and digital space! Does anyone have any recommendations or things they do to calm a racing mind or keep their working environment as organised as possible?

As we celebrate 10 years of Most Wanted Wines, we’re proud to unveil an exciting brand refresh that reflects how far we’ve come—and where we’re headed next.

From our roots disrupting the wine aisle back in 2015 to becoming a staple at live music events in 2025, we’ve always done things a little differently. And now, with our new platform, “the wine for it,” we’re leaning into what we do best—delivering the perfect wine option for every occasion.

Whether it’s a chilled night in, a spontaneous kitchen disco, or your favourite band taking the stage, Most Wanted is always the wine for it.

🎶 This year, we will be announcing some incredible music-led partnerships, alongside our growing presence at festivals, venues and live events. We’re doubling down on what sets us apart, cementing our place as the wine brand for music.

Our updated design brings clarity to our range reinforcing the right wine for the every occasion across three tiers:
🍷 Classics – everyday go-to favourites
🌍 Selections – curated regional picks
✨ Editions – premium wines from iconic global regions
Here’s to a new chapter, and many more moments worth raising a glass (or can) to.

For 46 people who asked “can I go and hug my grandchildren now or see my friends?” Once for every elderly person who hadn’t seen another human for months on end.

Our CEO, Mark Lloyd, says:

""We are very pleased to see that EDF is reconsidering and will continue to examine their proposals as they develop. However, any deterrent at Hinkley won’t be completely effective, so they must also commit to restoring degraded areas of the Severn Estuary—home to several iconic fish species—and improving fish passage in all its connected rivers.""

As well as a packed programme of 25 sales offering over 4,100 vehicles at BCA Online tomorrow, the annual Bangers4Ben sale takes place at 3pm, auctioning vehicles that took part in this year’s international rally with all sale proceeds going to automotive charity, Ben.
 
The 2024 Bangers4Ben rally covered around 1,500 miles across mainland Europe and the Alps, covering some of the best roads and mountain passes that France and Switzerland have to offer.
 
Entrants had to buy their car for no more than £750 then theme, paint or decal it before converging on Folkestone last month to embark on the rally in aid of Ben, with funds raised going towards the vital work the charity does for those in need who work or have worked in the motor industry.
 
The Bangers4Ben sale features 20 vehicles from the event, including a 2007 Fiat Scudo van reinvented as Thomas the Tank Engine, a 2006 Mercedes-Benz E320 3.0 saloon carrying C3PO and R2D2 from Star Wars as passengers and a fur lined 2004 MG TF 1.8 Roadster redesigned as Jerry the Mouse, from the famous Hanna-Barbera cartoons. Other delights on offer included a 1997 Vauxhall Tigra Marine Coupe styled as Tigger from Winnie the Pooh and a patchwork quilt 2001 Volvo V40 2.0 Estate.

At Bangers4Ben 2024, the engines roar,
A race of passion, for a cause we adore.
Rusty old cars, with hearts full of speed,
Each one driven to serve a noble need.

From junkyard dreams to track-side pride,
In every banger, stories collide.
Painted with laughter, covered in grime,
They roll for charity, one lap at a time.

For Ben, the cause, they gather as one,
Through twists and turns, under autumn’s sun.
Not just for victory, but something more,
To lend a helping hand, to open a door.

With wheels that wobble, but spirits strong,
They drive with purpose all day long.
A festival of fun, a tribute to care,
Where community thrives, and memories share.

So here’s to the racers, the cars that may bend,
At Bangers4Ben, where the journey’s the end.
2024, a year to be bold,
In engines and hearts, let the stories unfold.

Talent 27 has been recognised as one of the UK's Greatest Recruitment Companies to work for 2024, earning the Hyer Culture 100 award. 🎉

This award celebrates businesses that prioritise a progressive, people-first workplace. Talent 27's mission from the start has been to lead change in the recruitment industry by creating a safe and supportive environment where every individual, no matter their job title, is held accountable in terms of values and ethics.

We are not about ticking boxes, we want real change. We understand the huge responsibility we have to many young and sometimes vulnerable personalities that come into recruitment. I personally do not shy away from this responsibility, and hopefully those who know me, can see that I truly care about what we are trying to do here at Talent 27.

Cultures of fear, gender inequality, and cult-like conformity that exist in the recruitment industry need to stop.

I'm proud to be a part of Talent 27's journey, thank you to each member of the T27 team. 🌟

This ‘stopgap accommodation’ can often be rat and mold infested but is becoming home from 2+ years to families up and down the country. As taxpayers, we’re paying loads of money to house people in places that make them sick, remove their hope and diminish their opportunities. 

Yet, anyone in the business of trying to build more housing will likely have been told at a public consultation recently that ‘we don’t need more homes in [insert name of city, town or village here]’. 

What can be done to help?

- Publishing TA stats right alongside housing targets and proposals. The public have to be given the whole picture. 

- Councillors should visit TA at the same time as pre-committee site visits. They should ask themselves, would I want to raise my family here? Are the concerns expressed by the residents against a planning application more of a concern than the living conditions of the TA residents? There is a human cost of turning down applications. 

- Challenge your local representatives to tell you what they are doing to address this issue and vote accordingly. I can guarantee that opponents are asking their representatives the very opposite and doing it quite loudly. Let’s be louder.

The sheer ambition of it is impressive - got to take your hat off the government to pulling all the leavers they can to make the changes they feel are necessary. 

There are so many changes coming our way with the NPPF, devolution, and now this Bill – is it too much at once – can the creaking system adapt and survive? Can it be done in time to make a difference before we all head back to the ballot box? 

If you tuned in yesterday, you know that implementation of the measures in this bill will take time. 

📰 Spatial Development Strategies need combined authorities in place, some already do exist of course, but then they need time and resource to be put to their creation. It is unrealistic to think we'll see any within this Parliament. 

🙋‍♀️ Planning committee reform, unlikely to be at the top of the agenda for LPAs who are unsure of whether they will exist in two years’ time and the focus of local government's minds on the mammoth task of devolution at the moment should not be underestimated.

However, we’ve seen the mention of ‘grey belt’ move the dial on some decisions and BNG already felt like policy by the time it was officially ushered in. The intention set by the Bill has the ability to change the course of the sector, way before royal assent. 

Keep an eye out for the details as they come forward in the form of regulation, this is important for things like the implantation of planning fee reform, the national scheme of delegation and the roll out of the Nature Restoration Fund. 

For now, however, let's hope that the overarching message of the Bill is received loud and clear by everyone who has a chance to influence the growth and regeneration of this country. It's time to speed up planning decisions, remove unnecessary blockers and deliver.

I have just been advised that schuh sell single shoes to their customers, well done Schuh! 

Hoping my network may be able to offer some advice or have contacts who can help.
So what do you do as a 15 year old girl, who has lost her right leg after a battle with bone cancer, when you want to buy running trainers to start getting active again with you newly fitted Ottobock blade which doesn't require a trainer. You only need the left trainer and want to invest in some new ones to start this next chapter of your new life. The dilemma one of my best friends daughters had last week

Let me share the story with a bit more detail. Halle has been very sporty throughout childhood, really good at football and generally any sport she decided to play. In August 2023 Halle's world changed forever when they were given the news that she had osteosarcoma, a rare form of bone disease. Halle has undergone a year of aggressive chemotherapy and in January this year underwent surgery to remove her right leg from just above her knee. This meant that she had the best possible chance of the cancer not spreading and being free of the disease.

Halle and her parents, Maddy and James have dealt with the past year with such positvity, resilience and in all honesty are just incredible. She now has so many plans of things she wants to achieve and such a great example of others going through the same journey. She is recovering incredibly well and last week at her enablement appointment was told that she could be fitted for a running blade, so she will be able to start running again. 

I met up with Maddy last week and she explained that because a trainer isn't required for the running blade she had reached out to a running brand she herself had recently bought from, HOKA to see if there was any way they could purchase one trainer. Sadly she received the response yesterday which is shown here that this wasn't an option in their system 🙄 but thanked her for sharing her story. Disappointing.

I have reached out to an old colleague who now works at adidas and we are hopeful they may be able to help.

But it certainly got me thinking and frustrated, surely there are options for amputees or those with disabilities that mean they just don't ned to spend out on tow shies when only 1 is required?

I also thought back to my days as a student working in a shoe shop, we constantly had one shoe go missing and would be left with an odd one that got sent back to head office and probably ended up in landfill.

I'm hoping there is a solution for Halle, she definitely deserves this and so much more.

Nike, Brooks Running, do you have any suggestions?

The picture shows Halle in her normal prosthetic that she wears to walk around, this one requires both trainers as you can see but the running blade doesn't need a shoe.

Comment, like and share as I'm on a mission to resolve this for them. I can't believe that with the Paralympics just behind us there isn’t more help with this",53,36,11,7mo,Gavin Foyle reposted this,Cathy Knight,https://www.linkedin.com/in/cathy-knight,,2024-09-21T09:14:08.727Z,,,

Ensuring a clean and safe swimming pool environment goes far beyond just chemical balance and regular cleaning. One often overlooked but important aspect is the inspection of swimming pool filter vessels.

Regular inspections of filter vessels are vital for several reasons:

1. Safety - Pool filter vessels operate under high pressure, and any undetected weaknesses or defects can lead to failures. Regular inspections help prevent accidents, ensuring the safety of both swimmers and maintenance staff.

2. Optimal Performance - A well-maintained filter vessel ensures that your filtration system operates at peak efficiency, keeping your pool water clear and free from contaminants.

3. Cost Efficiency - Identifying issues early through regular inspections can save you from costly repairs or complete system replacements down the line. It’s an investment in the long-term health of your pool infrastructure.

By prioritizing filter vessel inspections, you’re not just maintaining a pool—you’re safeguarding a community’s health and well-being.

At Broadwater Technologies Ltd, we take pride in celebrating the multifaceted talents of our team. Today, we're excited to spotlight Philip Moore, who not only excels in his role with us but also serves as the European President of Tchoukball.

What’s Tchoukball, you ask? 
Tchoukball is a dynamic and inclusive sport that combines elements of handball and volleyball. Played on an indoor court, it involves two teams aiming to score points by rebounding a ball off a frame at either end of the court. The catch? The opposing team can't intercept but must prevent the ball from hitting the ground. It's a game of strategy, agility, and teamwork—much like the work we do here at Broadwater!

European Championship 2024
 As the European President of Tchoukball, Phil Moore plays a crucial role in promoting and organizing the sport across the continent. Last week, he spearheaded the European Tchoukball Championship in Ferrara, Italy. Under his leadership, the event brought together talented teams from various countries, fostering a spirit of camaraderie and competition. 

Join us in congratulating Phil on his incredible achievements and for bringing the same energy and commitment to Broadwater Technologies that he does to the world of Tchoukball. We're lucky to have you on our team, Phil! 🌟👏

I was so shocked to hear the news about the shocking death of TV presenter Michael Moseley who died last week while taking a walk in Greece. Everyone at One Tribe TV sends our condolences to his family and friends . I had the pleasure of working with him closely for around two years while in BBC Science on the series “Inventions the Changed The World”. At the time he was still an TV executive producer and I was the series producer- it was back in the 00’s . Owen Gay our creative director worked with him when he started presenting on The One Show . Michael had a unique gift of being able to make science and health content accessible and interesting to a mainstream TV audience. This is such a rare ability driven by this infectious and genuine enthusiasm and energy . The last time I saw Michael was when we walking down the Red carpet at the BAFTA’s in London having both arrived by tube .

“SpringHill, which grew to 200 employees, raised money at the top of the market for production companies, back when streaming services were adding billions of dollars to their budgets each year to chase new customers.”

In a world where eyeballs are moving towards creator-owned media companies with smaller staff, reliance on outside vendors, and direct distribution to consumers, I don’t see how viable it is to sustain a 200 person “small” independent production company. Which in and of itself has potentially seismic impact on entertainment industry jobs. Then you add on real estate rental and other overhead, and it’s hard to make the math work given the pullback on exorbitant streamer spending. 

Everything across media (other than AAA/tentpole) seems to be moving towards smaller teams, lower overhead, and leveraging online media it seems. Disruptive times…",297,63,25,5mo,Miles Bullough reposted this,Simon Pulman,https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonpulman,,2024-12-02T18:09:24.689Z,,,

Dodo is such a lovely series – funny, compassionate, cringe-making (in a good way) – it celebrates the moment when we first go to secondary school and try to fit in and the fantasy worlds kids create to try and make sense of everything. It plots our first steps in teenage friendship, dating – the loss of innocence that primary school protects – the beginning of the emergence of our adult personalities.

It feels like the perfect time to reflect on what’s already been an incredible start to 2025.

We’re only seven weeks in, but so much has happened:

✅ Oculus Legal Group entered the Timberseed Top 50 list of largest specialist legal recruitment companies at number 23. Thanks Joe Thomson for including us.
✅ Record-breaking new business month in January and on course to beat it in February!
✅ 35 candidates successfully placed with some incredible clients across the UK and closing in on placing our 200th Candidate since we started the business
✅ All four of our new hires settling in and already making a huge impact; Misty Bennett Sarajaine M. Michael Dowlman Chloe Jermyn
✅ Ffion Watts & Ellie Marshall jetted off to New York as winners of our first Top Billers Incentive

Momentum is one of the hardest things to generate in recruitment but once you have, its about doubling down and pushing even harder. 

Being surrounded by a team that constantly pushes for more and goes the extra mile for clients and candidates is what makes this journey so exciting.

With space for six more hires in our new offices, we’re looking for recruiters from any sector who want to make their mark in legal recruitment. Drop me a message if you are keen to find out more!

We had the pleasure of holding a fantastic Devon Contractors Team Meeting this week – both in the office and on Teams – bringing together colleagues from across the business.

It was a valuable chance to share updates on the company, celebrate recent successes in work-winning, and introduce some exciting new initiatives coming soon. Plenty of insights (and laughs!) were shared along the way.
These sessions are key to making sure everyone is aligned with the same message – whether you're based on-site or in the office. It’s all part of building a stronger, more connected Devon Contractors team.

Thank you to everyone who took part – here’s to another year of delivering quality projects together.

I must admit I hadn't realised the depth of skill in this area still sat here in the UK. Advanced manufacture is alive and kicking and I'm grateful to everyone who responded and will be in contact.

For us I think part of this is coming from the environmental impact of production of plastics and how we try and lower that impact in a market where those materials are the only option, but also the growing uncertainty around supply in a rapidly changing global landscape - we want to make sure that when we have product in market that we can supply all territories at a cost that makes sense to the customer and isn't artificially hiked - more so in diagnostics...

We are making this available as a wet chemistry to researchers in oder to extend to range of suitable sample types and to different targets. 

Simply add reagent A directly into your sample for instantaneous lyse at room temperature, followed by reagent B to neutralise it.

One of the greatest challenges in integrating Para into a historically established sport like modern pentathlon is not the physical logistics — it’s the knowledge gap. Misconceptions, unconscious bias, and a lack of understanding can create invisible barriers that hold us back from true inclusivity.

That’s why I’m proud to share a major milestone: the launch of a new educational module developed as one of the first initiatives of the UIPM - World Pentathlon Para Commission with support from the classification research ongoing at Liverpool John Moores University 

This resource has been designed for national pentathlon federations, officials, coaches, and athletes — a foundational step toward building a global culture of understanding and support for Para Pentathlon. From demystifying classification procedures to providing practical tips for training and competition, our goal is to empower everyone involved with the tools and knowledge to embrace and elevate Para sport.

This is more than a module — it’s a movement to shift perspectives, break down stigma, and champion equity in sport.

Let’s keep learning. Let’s keep opening doors.

That’s why we’re proud to support incredible initiatives through our Fund For Good, including our long-standing partnership with Just a Drop. Recently, our very own Marie had the opportunity to volunteer with Just a Drop and their local partner Water for Cambodia in Siem Reap - and what an experience it was!

Over the course of 4 days, Marie got stuck into: 
💧 Building and installing biosand water filters in family homes
🧼 Visiting an Eco Soap Bank to help recycle hotel soap into life-changing hygiene supplies
🌱 Planting trees and delivering fun, glitter-filled hygiene workshops in local schools
…all while seeing first-hand the long-term impact that clean water and sanitation access has on families, schools, and entire communities.

The more we grow bookings, the more we can give back. Every trip booked through TravelLocal helps fund community-driven projects like these — creating meaningful impact far beyond the destination.

At South West Apprenticeship Company Limited (SWAC), mentoring isn’t just something we “do” - it’s in our DNA. This month we shone the spotlight on the people, practices, and lightbulb moments that make mentoring such a game-changer for apprentices and employers. 

Here’s a little rewind of what we got up to 👇 

🚀 Why Every Apprentice Deserves a Mentor
 We kicked off with the “why”. Spoiler alert: because mentors change everything. I shared a bit about my own experience in banking - when someone believed in me before I knew how to believe in myself. That’s the magic. At SWAC, every apprentice gets a mentor who’s there not just for day one, but for the whole journey.

🏆 Top 10 Qualities of a Great Mentor
 We dug into what makes someone a mentor worth their weight in gold. Generous with time, brilliant listeners, able to challenge and cheerlead in equal measure. The best ones aren’t trying to impress - they’re trying to uplift.

🌱 How to Be a Brilliant Mentee
 Mentoring’s a two-way street - and the best mentees don’t just show up, they step up. Set goals, ask questions, be open to feedback (even the tricky stuff), and say thank you. A mentor can open the door - but you’ve got to walk through it.

⚡ Mentor vs. Manager: Let’s Clear It Up
 Not the same thing! Managers help you tick off your tasks. Mentors help you figure out what you’re really good at—and where you want to go. You need both, but they play very different roles in your growth.

🔄 Reverse Mentoring: Yes, Really.
 Here’s where things got juicy. Apprentices have a lot to teach the rest of us- especially around tech, trends, and fresh perspectives. The best leaders are the ones who keep learning—and sometimes that learning comes from someone half your age.

💬 The Big Takeaway?
Mentoring isn’t just a “nice to have”. It’s a superpower. It builds confidence, connection, and cultures where people don’t just survive—they thrive. If your apprentices don’t have a mentor yet, it’s time to change that. (Need help? You know where I am.)

To everyone who joined the conversation, shared their stories, or simply cheered us on—thank you. Let’s keep building workplaces where everyone has someone in their corner. 💪

Yes. Yes, we do. And trust me—it can be a game-changer!

Reverse mentoring is shaking up your workplace in the best possible way. Instead of the usual top-down knowledge transfer, apprentices and newer employees mentor the senior leaders… 

To quote Richard Branson; “The direction that reverse mentoring is heading in is brilliant too - particularly in the way it drives inclusion and helps everyone feel like they belong.”

And it’s not found in any textbook.

Getting comfortable asking for what you want is a superpower few people develop early enough.

With my daughter, I'm intentionally building this skill.

Teaching her to articulate her goals, engage others in her vision and make direct requests without apology. Not just with family, but with teachers, sports coaches and other adults in her world.

But this a pattern I also recognise from everywhere - colleagues waiting for the ""right time"" to pitch ideas, professionals delaying career moves until they feel ""fully ready.”

We're taught to wait for permission rather than ask for what we need.

Why permission-waiting holds us back:

- Opportunities rarely announce themselves - they respond to direct requests
- Decision-makers can't address needs they don't know exist
- Self-advocacy skills compound in value over decades
- Waiting creates a widening gap between potential and achievement
- Initiative consistently outperforms obedience in today's workplace

Key principles anyone can apply:

1. 𝗠𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗮𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗵𝗮𝗯𝗶𝘁, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗮𝗻 𝗲𝘅𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: The skill of requesting what you need should be practiced regularly, not reserved for rare occasions.
2. 𝗙𝗼𝗰𝘂𝘀 𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘃𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗲 𝗲𝘅𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲: frame requests around mutual benefit: ""Here's what I'm trying to accomplish and how you can help.""
3. 𝗗𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗼𝘂𝘁𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝘁𝘆: a rejected request doesn't mean you're unworthy - it’s just a misaligned opportunity.
4. 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗶𝗰 𝗮𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀: know when, how, and to whom specific requests should be made for maximum effectiveness.
5. 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘄𝗮𝗻𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝘀𝗲𝗲: leaders who ask directly create cultures where others feel empowered to do the same.

𝗣𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝘄𝗮𝘆𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗴𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗮𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀

- Request one stretch opportunity each month that feels slightly out of reach
- Replace ""Just checking if..."" with ""I'd like to propose...""
- Track and celebrate requests made, not just those granted
- Identify three places you're currently waiting for permission unnecessarily
- Study how effective people in your field make and frame their asks

What are you waiting for someone else to authorise that you could simply start doing today?

The most self-defeating question in leadership.

It's equivalent to asking ""Would you like some training?"" without mentioning what for.

1. 𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗴𝗮𝗽

When you mean ""development,"" they translate to ""deficiency.""

2. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗵𝗶𝗱𝗱𝗲𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗴𝗲𝗿𝘀
""Do you want coaching?"" activates immediate mental barriers:
""I don't have time for another commitment""
""What am I doing wrong?""
""Is this a performance issue?""
""How will this look to others?""

3. 𝗩𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗻𝘀 𝗶𝗻𝘃𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗹𝗲
Coaching's true benefits stay hidden behind vague terminology.
The transformation potential never enters the conversation.

𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝘁𝗼 𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗰𝗼𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴:

1.  𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗱 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗰𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗰 𝗼𝘂𝘁𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗲𝘀
""Who wants to make decisions with 30% more confidence?""
""Who's interested in reducing team conflict by half?""
""Who would like to cut meeting time while improving results?""

2. 𝗙𝗿𝗮𝗺𝗲 𝗶𝘁 𝗮𝘀 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗮𝗰𝗰𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻
Position coaching as the competitive advantage it is.
Elite athletes don't question coaching - they demand it.

3. 𝗦𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗿𝗲𝘁𝗲 𝘀𝘂𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗽𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝘀
""Team members who engaged in our coaching programme last quarter reported 40% higher job satisfaction and delivered projects 25% faster.""

4. 𝗖𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗙𝗢𝗠𝗢, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻
Make coaching feel like an opportunity everyone deserves.
Universal access with personalised impact creates genuine engagement.

The strongest teams don't receive coaching because they're struggling.

What specific performance breakthrough would be most valuable to each of your team members right now?

It's not training.

And it's definitely not just for ""fixing problems.""

Here are 6 coaching myths debunked;
1.𝗛𝗶𝗴𝗵 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗱𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝗰𝗼𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗲𝘀
↳ The elite in every field have coaches.
↳ The best leaders seek feedback before it's required
↳ Waiting until you're struggling means starting from behind
𝗦𝗲𝗹𝗳-𝗰𝗼𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗶𝗽: Schedule regular ""performance reviews"" with yourself to reflect on successes, challenges and gaps. Don't wait for external triggers to evaluate performance.

2.𝗖𝗼𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝗼𝗻𝗹𝘆 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝘁𝗼𝗽 𝗲𝘅𝗲𝗰𝘂𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲𝘀
↳ Effective coaching should be accessible at all levels
↳ Democratising development creates organisational resilience
↳ When coaching reaches everyone, innovation and engagement flourish
𝗦𝗲𝗹𝗳-𝗰𝗼𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗶𝗽: Build peer coaching circles and meet colleagues monthly to share challenges and ask questions.

3.𝗖𝗼𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝗳𝗼𝗰𝘂𝘀 𝗼𝗻 𝘄𝗲𝗮𝗸𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀
↳ Exceptional performance comes from leveraging strengths
↳ Fixing weaknesses creates adequacy, not excellence
↳ The greatest ROI is in your top capabilities, not your bottom ones
𝗦𝗲𝗹𝗳-𝗰𝗼𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗶𝗽: Identify your top three strengths and focus 60% of your week on them. Track the energy and results that come from this versus time spent compensating for weaknesses.

4.𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗼𝘄𝘀 𝗮 𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗮𝗿 𝗽𝗮𝘁𝗵
↳ Growth happens in bursts, not steady increments
↳ Plateau periods are where integration happens
↳ The most valuable lessons often come from detours, not the main road
𝗦𝗲𝗹𝗳-𝗰𝗼𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗶𝗽: Keep a ""growth journal"" to track insights and breakthroughs. When you hit a plateau, review your journal to recognise progress and trigger patterns for growth spurts. Embrace plateaus as consolidation periods, not failures.

5.𝗔 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗰𝗼𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗴𝗶𝘃𝗲𝘀 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝘀𝘄𝗲𝗿𝘀
↳ Exceptional coaches ask questions you can't Google
↳ The answers that transform are the ones you discover yourself
↳ True clarity comes from within, not from external prescription
𝗦𝗲𝗹𝗳-𝗰𝗼𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗶𝗽: Build a set of powerful questions when facing challenges: ""What assumptions am I making?"" ""What would I advise someone else in this situation?"" ""What's the opportunity hidden in this problem?"" Regular use builds sharper self-reflection. 💪

6.𝗖𝗼𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗺𝗮𝗿𝗶𝗹𝘆 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗴𝗼𝗮𝗹𝘀
↳ Goals are the vehicle, not the destination
↳ Great coaching sharpens thinking and action
↳ When coaching works, you solve problems before they arise
𝗦𝗲𝗹𝗳-𝗰𝗼𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗶𝗽: Check how your thinking evolved before chasing the next goal. Ask yourself: ""How has my approach to problem-solving changed?"" ""What new capabilities have I developed?"" These insights are often more valuable than the goal itself.

 Acknowledges potential blind spots and invites perspective.
3. ""𝗢𝗻 𝗮 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲 𝗼𝗳 1-10, 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘄𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸?""

4. ""𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁'𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗸 𝗜 𝗺𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝘄𝗮𝗻𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗵𝗲𝗮𝗿?""

5. ""𝗪𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗺 𝗜 𝘀𝗲𝘁𝘁𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝗜 𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝗯𝗲 𝗲𝘅𝗰𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴?""
 Focuses feedback on potential rather than criticism.

The most valuable professional relationships aren't with people who protect your feelings - they're with those who protect your future by telling you what you need to hear.

When was the last time you received feedback that made you uncomfortable but helped you grow?

This exciting development will deliver 80 new homes, including 20 affordable dwellings of mixed tenure and size, featuring two wheelchair-accessible houses, to meet the evolving needs of the local community.

The scheme’s layout and design were shaped through extensive collaboration with the local authority, including design workshops to align closely with their vision for the site. We also benefited from design panel reviews with experienced professionals from multiple disciplines, helping us ensure the proposals integrate seamlessly into the character and context of Cotford St Luke.

Sustainability at the Core
We’re proud to say that sustainability has been embedded throughout the project. From energy-efficient design to biodiversity enhancements and infrastructure for active travel and integrated places for social interaction, our goal is to deliver a development that’s environmentally responsible and built for the future.

A huge thank you to everyone involved in getting us to this stage — now onto the working drawing phase as we bring the vision to life!

We've officially reached the end of defects period on the project, and a site visit last Friday morning enabled us to check in with the end users. It was wonderful to see how loved the library is by both the staff and all its visitors. In its first year, the library saw around 150,00 visitors, nearly double than what the previous library received! 
 
It was great to hear about the many services the library has to offer and the positive engagement it has had within the local community. We are proud to be a part of the library’s journey to this point.

Just putting the final touches to our brand strategy document. 

Milk & Tweed has changed so much over the last 6 years. Bigger studio, bigger customers, and even BIGGER Christmas bar bills.

But our brand and website hasn't changed. We have been wanting to do a new website for the last 2 years, but still haven't got round to doing it - always so hard to do your own work.

So we wanted to revisit our brand strategy before we embarked on a brand tweak and a new website. And after doing it, I am so excited for it, and the future of Milk & Tweed - exciting times ahead :)

Recently I had a strengths workshop, where I had to take a test with Gallup. Below were my results. 

I have always had the mindset of, leaning into what you enjoy and your strengths. Rather than focussing on what you are not very good at. I think our education system could do this a little more to be honest.

We've officially reached the end of defects period on the project, and a site visit last Friday morning enabled us to check in with the end users. It was wonderful to see how loved the library is by both the staff and all its visitors. In its first year, the library saw around 150,00 visitors, nearly double than what the previous library received! 
 
It was great to hear about the many services the library has to offer and the positive engagement it has had within the local community. We are proud to be a part of the library’s journey to this point.

Last night was Anti Banquet, bringing Bristol businesses together to raise money for grassroots causes - funding some of our city’s most vital community food projects that support people in need.

The idea is simple: businesses buy a table, and their CEOs and Directors work in the kitchen or serve their guests.

The execution is not so simple. It was great to see first hand the skill, dedication and hard graft involved by a huge amount of people in the planning and staging for an event for nearly 1,000 people. And a point of pride that my first waiting job was for the incredible Josh Eggleton and his team (though I've yet to be offered a full-time role).

A wonderful cause and a memorable evening - definitely one to add to the diary for next year.

Kudos to everyone who generously gave their time to make it happen.

And I didn’t mind. I didn’t feel an idiot. Or not want to make a suggestion ever again. 

And that's because a TAB board is such a safe space. Even for the facilitator! 

Everyone brings a key issue along each month. Lots of ideas and suggestions are freely given as to how that issue might be addressed. 

And because it's a safe place, comprising peers with no vested interest other than wanting to help each other, people are comfortable with making all sorts of suggestions. 

Many are really helpful and occasionally some are like my recent one! And that's okay. 

I really like a Sir Ken Robertson talk in which he points out that children are far more creative than adults partly because they are less fearful about making mistakes.

He observes: ‘Kids are not frightened of being wrong. I don’t mean to say that being wrong is the same as being creative, but what we do know is that if you’re not prepared to be wrong you will never come up with anything original.’ 

So, what did I come out with?

Simply that whilst discussing a member’s possible new service – and with several people present knowing rather a lot about brand – I decided to suggest a name for the new service that relied on a poor pun and was almost impossible to pronounce. 

But I’ll not hesitate to suggest something next time! Even a new service name! 😉

TAB Exeter peer boards meet monthly and comprise local business owners who help each other to better their businesses by advising each other on the challenges and opportunities they face. Everyone benefits from the collective relevant experience round the table. I’ve been running them for more than five years. 

I also run complimentary Business Owners’ Boards at Exeter Golf & Country Club and the next one is on Thurs 15th May (9am to 11.30am). Look out for other LinkedIn Posts for Eventbrite details.",17,0,0,4d,Post,Rick Dent,https://www.linkedin.com/in/rick-dent,,2025-04-29T16:01:37.901Z,,,

If you own or run a business, a little additional steer or a nugget of an idea to help address a business issue that’s on your mind might prove very useful. 

Come and join a number of other local business owners who have already registered to attend my latest complimentary business owners’ board. 

The session is for local business owners who:

 ▶️ would value advice from experienced peers on a business issue that’s on their mind

 ▶️ would like to meet and help other Exeter & Devon business owners 

 ▶️ are interested in experiencing how TAB’s business owner boards help but are not sure what is involved or how it feels

The meeting at Exeter Golf & Country Club on Thurs 15th May (9am to 11.30am) is complimentary and without expectation of further commitment.

The average rating from the 60+ owners who have attended previous sessions is 9 out of 10 for being ‘a valuable use of my time.’

You can read more about it and register via the Eventbrite link in the comments section.

Come and get some support and fresh ideas!

There are fears that Trump could disrupt services through tariffs or executive orders. Although Microsoft has promised legal action to protect European access, concerns persist. Even without a complete shutdown, political pressure could lead to service slowdowns or interruptions, impacting critical digital infrastructure. As one executive put it: “The only thing guaranteed is uncertainty.”

This kind of uncertainty can certainly feel unsettling. For those feeling anxious about this or other challenges, it might help to remember that uncertainty is a part of life. Take a deep breath and focus on the next step forward. Sometimes, the best approach is to maintain a positive outlook, take the high ground in any related discussions, and allow heated situations to eventually cool down.

The system creates the conditions for our actions. And anyone who consistently takes an action is doing it because based on who they are, what they see, what they believe, and the feedback loop they're in, this is exactly the right thing to do.

Perhaps they might change what they do if they saw something else, if they received different feedback from the system, or if their status shifted.

We can show up with a story that resonates, and we can create the conditions for people to make different choices.

But we cannot easily persuade someone that they are wrong. (Seth Godin)

In it's simplest form it is who we want to be tomorrow.  Strategy should be applied to ourselves, our businesses, our communities, our nation and the world at large - hopefully for good.

A bad strategy is not knowing where we want to be tomorrow, as we will attempt to go in many directions at the same time and get nowhere.

Not because they didn’t love what they do.
Not because they lacked passion, skill, or commitment.

They left because they simply couldn’t afford to stay.

These were care professionals through and through , heroes, each one of them.

They showed up with heart.

They held hands through grief, they enabled dignity, they sparked joy.

And now?

They’re heading to McDonald’s because it pays more.

Let that sink in.

We are losing some of the most compassionate, skilled, and selfless people in this country not to burnout, not to disillusionment but to poverty pay.

And I’m angry.😡 

Because I want to pay them more.
I should be able to pay them more.
But without fair uplifts, without funding that reflects the real cost of care, our hands are tied.

They’re not leaving me.
They’re being pushed out of a sector they love, by a system that keeps telling them they don’t matter.

This is a loss to all of us.
To the people we support.
To families.
To the future of care.

And I know I’m not the only one watching this happen.

To the government officials tracking “capacity” I hope you track the compassion that’s slipping through your fingers aswell.

These are not numbers.
These are people.
And every time we lose one, the system gets weaker.

This is what we’re fighting for at Providers Unite.
Because without change, there won’t be a workforce left to lead.

The consequences of silencing, and indeed removing, those who try to prevent harm are devastating. In the case of Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, it led to further preventable infant deaths and a knowingly dishonest media strategy designed to cover up.

I’ve spent 20+ years in recruitment, and one thing I’ve learnt is this:

A great CV doesn’t always mean a great hire.
It tells you what someone’s done. Not who they are.
Not their hunger. Not their resilience. Not how they show up for their team when it counts.

So I wrote this:

People Not Paper – Why It’s Time to Look Beyond the CV
https://lnkd.in/g34tx7BC 

It’s a reminder that some of the best hires you’ll ever make won’t have the ‘perfect’ background.

But they’ll bring fire, values, and the right mindset. And that’s what makes a team stronger.

In the piece I talk about:

Why potential beats just experience
The power of balancing your Harry Kanes with your Jude Bellinghams
The importance of trusting your gut—but backing it up with process
The questions we should really be asking in interviews

We use this approach at Kingston Barnes. It’s helped us build a team I’m proud of—and helped our clients build better ones too.

Have a read if you’ve ever been burned by a ‘perfect on paper’ hire… or want to avoid making that mistake in future.

👇 I’d love to know:

 What’s the best off-paper quality you’ve ever hired someone for?

Plenty of great conversations and even better ideas around how we can attract, engage and retain the next generation of professionals. There’s a real opportunity to shake things up – not just talk about it, but take action.

Lots of takeaways, one program in the making in partnership with West of England Mayoral Combined Authority (watch this space) and one idea I’m especially excited about (thanks jackie pinder), Reverse mentoring – which we’ll be introducing at Kingston Barnes | B Corp™ this quarter. It’s time to listen, learn and leverage the insight Gen Z can bring to leadership.

Expert instruction, first-class hospitality, and a lemon drizzle cake so good it nearly sparked its own shoot-out.

We may have won our own competition – which feels a bit like scoring your own appraisal – but Joshua Spokes from Mud Mortar came within one shot of stealing it. Strong shooting sir. 

Huge thanks to Kathryn Westwood and Ladyswood for organising the day to perfection – and to everyone who joined us for some friendly fire, fierce competition, and a lot of laughs.

Have you ever noticed a specific spot in your home or building that just stays chilly, no matter how high you turn up the heating? These are known as cold spots. While they might seem like minor annoyances, they often signal more serious underlying issues that need attention.

This article (in full below on the link) explores the key changes from PAS 2035:2019 and the difference in approaches required for this wave.

Note the adoption timeline for PAS 2035:2023 - it is intended that users will commence adoption of PAS 2035:2023 immediately following publication, with the goal of fully meeting its requirements and claiming compliance with PAS 2030:2023 (and therefore PAS 2035:2023) from the 30th of March 2025. At this point, PAS 2035:2019+A1:2022 will be withdrawn, so retrofit professionals must transition to the new standard now.

To successfully navigate these changes and ensure your projects are fully compliant, timely adoption of the updated standard is critical. If you need support with PAS 2035 compliance and retrofit assessments, get in touch with us, our experts can help you meet the latest standards and ensure your retrofit projects are a success.

It has stayed with us through office moves, Covid and various business changes. Day to day I forget it's there and every so often, when I need a reminder it catches my eye.

So I'm sharing in case you need reminding today.....


It's ok to...Be wrong. Cry. Say you don't know. Have a tough day. Ask for help. Fail. Have a different opinion. Take a break when you need it.

It's great to... Ask questions. Put your hand up when you make mistakes. Go home. Be ambitious. Go for a walk to clear your head. Switch off completely during holidays.

Please...Be kind. Be helpful. Be mindful of your own limits. Share knowledge. Ask people how they're doing. Remember there are no silly questions. Leave things better than you found them.

You should...Talk to people about doubts and concerns. Be yourself. Give candid, timely feedback. Be honest, even when it's uncomfortable.

Try to...Soften the edges. Be hard on problems, not people (including yourself). Put your ego aside.

20% of the #Bristol workforce are employed by a Charter Signatory!

Incredibly well organised and jam packed event last night from Sonia Cohen Kristal McNamara and Sandra Gordon! Progress updates, key note speakers, a panel and 5 minutes that matter. I think my brain is still processing my notes…..

A few key points that stuck- 

The successes from Signatories
✅ Gender balanced leadership teams
✅ Growth of access to mentorships
✅ Reduction in gender pay gaps

Samantha Castle Reframing ""work life balance"" as ""a blend of the different hats"" we wear. We need flexibility from our work to wear them all well.

Ruth B. Blew my mind with her research showing gender inequality is GOOD for short term economic growth 😟 
But, if we reduce the gender pay gap by 1% we can increase economic growth by 3%

Sarah Coles Women typically have lumpier careers and it’s impacting savings. Not great news given we statically live longer....
The impact of the confidence (BS) gap in financial knowledge is negativity impacting the amount of investment made by women. We need education.

The incredible panel line up with Emma Wood Alice Bretherton, Clare Wilkinson, Rebecca Baldwin-Cantello as well as the key notes discussed: 

➡️ When we make positive changes for women, we are all impacted in a positive way
➡️ Making flexibility the structural foundation of business
➡️ A workplace “designed for all”
➡️ Institutional inclusion

I sat back and absorbed the lived experiences shared in the 5 minutes that matter from Tara Miran, Kyrby Brown, Bianca Jones, Matt Humberstone, Lewis Wedlock
Thank you for being so generous and impactful.

What an event! A huge congratulations to the Bristol Women in Business Charter team for putting it together and driving change in #Bristol. Thank you to all those who took part and shared insights, progress and the work still to be done.

If you are not already involved, I highly recommend you take a look!",61,7,1,5d,Post,Sharon Alred,https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharonalred,,2025-04-29T07:30:05.773Z,,,

When hiring new talent, we often talk about finding someone who's a ""good fit"" for our team. 
But what exactly do we mean by ""fit""? And does prioritising it undermine our diversity goals?
 
The ""Fit"" Trap

When we say we want someone who ""fits,"" are we really saying:
❓ Someone just like us?
❓ Another version of our top performer?
❓ A person who won't disrupt our comfortable status quo?

This approach creates the ultimate echo chamber - a team that thinks alike, acts alike, and ultimately, faces the same blind spots.
 
The Diversity Advantage

Research consistently shows that diverse teams outperform homogeneous ones. Diversity brings:
✅ Fresh perspectives on problems
✅ Different approaches to solutions
✅ Varied experiences that spark innovation
✅ Healthy friction that challenges assumptions

When team members think differently from one another, they're more likely to identify risks, spot opportunities, and create breakthrough ideas.
 
Redefining ""Fit""

True fit isn't about similarity - it's about complementary strengths. When hiring, consider:
➡️ What perspectives are missing from your current team?
➡️ Which skills would complement (not duplicate) existing talents?
➡️ How might different work styles enhance your team dynamic?

Values aligned, culture contribution.
 
The Short-Term vs. Long-Term Trade-off

When under pressure to fill positions quickly, it's tempting to choose someone who seems ""easier"" to integrate - someone familiar. But this short-term convenience often comes at a long-term cost to innovation, adaptability, and performance.
 
Moving Forward

Instead of asking ""Will they fit in?"" try asking:
☑️ Will they add something new to our team?
☑️ Do they share our core values while contributing to our culture?
☑️ How might they positively challenge our existing ways of thinking?

The most successful teams aren't built on sameness but on a foundation of shared purpose coupled with diverse approaches to achieving it.

Have you experienced the benefits of prioritizing diversity over conventional ""fit"" in your hiring process? Or have you seen the pitfalls of creating teams that are too similar?

How you handle your departure speaks volumes about your professional character and can impact future opportunities. 

People often remember the beginning, the end and the emotional peak/pit of an event. This translates into your work too. 

Here's how to ensure you leave on the best possible terms.
 
1 Give Appropriate Notice
-Deliver the news in person (or via video call) to your direct manager before telling colleagues
-Follow up with a formal resignation letter that includes your planned last day
 
2 Document Your Knowledge
-Create detailed handover documents that outline your responsibilities, processes, and ongoing projects, key contacts
-Add troubleshooting tips for common challenges in your role
-Perhaps record short video tutorials for complex processes
 
3 Train Your Replacement
-Develop a structured training plan for your remaining time
-Allow your replacement to shadow you and gradually take over tasks
-Be generous with your institutional knowledge - don't hoard information
 
4 Maintain Performance Standards
-Resist the temptation to mentally check out
-Complete as many outstanding projects as possible
-Don't start major new initiatives you can't finish
 
5 Set Colleagues Up for Success
-Introduce key contacts to the team members who will be taking over your responsibilities
-Transfer important relationships thoughtfully
-Ensure team members have access to necessary files, accounts, and resources
 
6 Exit Interviews and Feedback
-Participate constructively in exit interviews
-Offer honest but tactful feedback, focus on systems and processes rather than individuals
-Suggest practical improvements that could benefit the organization
 
7 Saying Goodbye
-Thank mentors and colleagues who supported your growth
-Consider a thoughtful email or card to the broader team
-If appropriate, bring in treats on your last day as a gesture of goodwill
 
8 Digital Housekeeping
-Return all company property and equipment
-Transfer ownership of accounts and documents
-Update passwords and access information for team accounts
 
9 Maintain Discretion After Leaving
-Never disparage your former employer or colleagues publicly
-Honour confidentiality agreements
-Be thoughtful about what you share on social media

Remember that industries can be surprisingly small, and professional paths often cross again. The impression you leave during your departure may well influence future opportunities, references, and collaborations.

There are around 11,000 wind turbines in the UK – generating clean energy for almost 30% of the national grid. But when it comes to generating power off-grid... which is right for you? 

A wind turbine or a CHP unit? 

Well, wind turbines require two things: wind and space. For a lot of the UK, generating power using wind turbines just isn't an option. 

A CHP unit using gas efficiently, will help you save money 24/7 and lower your emissions.

Last week, I had the privilege of attending Oxford University as part of the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses 10KSB UK program. This marked the half way point on this journey and I have been completely blown away with the quality of the course content and input from the team that runs #10KSB. Sitting in the Nelson Mandela Lecture Theatre, listening to some of the most amazing people from all areas of business is truly humbling. Who'd of thought it, leaving school at sixteen, I'd find myself in this incredible environment!

Being part of this cohort is one of the most inspiring things I have ever done. I'm surrounded by an amazing group of entrepreneurs who are passionate, driven, and making a real impact across the UK. The energy, ideas, and collaboration in the room are unlike anything I’ve experienced before. It feels so natural to be around so many people who are all living and breathing the day to day experiences of running a business, I no longer feel alone, so thank you to this wonderful bunch!

The 10KSB program is designed to help small businesses scale and thrive – and it’s doing exactly that. From world-class teaching to hands-on strategy development, it's been a game-changer already. The opportunity to step back, reflect, and work on the business rather than just in it has been invaluable.
Spending time at Oxford University last week – a place steeped in history and innovation – only made the journey more special. It was a moment to pause, connect, and re-energise for the road ahead.

To Goldman Sachs, Oxford University, and everyone involved in the programme – thank you. I’m incredibly proud to be part of this community and can’t wait to see where this journey leads next. 🚀

The sole reason I founded People for Research, was to solve the problem of poor quality participant recruitment in the market research industry, and that was back in the analogue days. Yes, I am that old! The problems encountered then have translated into the digital world we now operate in, the same issues just wearing different clothes.

With Ai and now Synth participant platforms entering the market, you cannot ignore the impact they will have in the space of participant recruitment. But they are not the answer to all the issues regarding fake and fraudulent participants. Participant verification is the buzz word for most online platforms, that's not hard to achieve but it's also not hard to defeat either for the most determined fake participants. Verification is just step one in the process, the other ingredient and I would argue the most important, is the validation/screening of every participant done by a human. User Research is essentially about what people actually do do and not what they say they will do, which we know differs, so why rely on a recruitment system which sources participants based on how they answer a self completion screener, saying what they would do? This is the way any automated system works, whether that's Ai or self-serve platform.

To fully embrace the Ai world into our processes, we must adopt a ""Human in the Loop"" approach. This requires the symbiotic relationship between tech and human to reach an outcome that meets the high value output I would expect from good participant recruitment.

There is one slight flaw in all of this, which is value. For years I have struggled with the actual value researchers have placed on participant recruitment. By value I mean cost, whilst researchers command high day rates, they will often reject high cost recruitment in favour of a cheaper one, whilst at the same time demanding high quality. You cannot have both, we all know that, yet it is THE most common thing I hear from researchers consistently from over three decades of working in this industry. The market research sector is by far the worst, whilst the user researcher sector is much better at recognising the value/cost in good quality recruitment. Could this be due to the fact that they are generally not from a market research background but born from a digital/design/tech sector?

To drive accurate high quality insight it is vital we use reliable, validated and screened participants with human in the loop approach for both qual and quant research.

For me, the jury is out, waiting further evidence regarding using tech to detect and reduce participant fraud. It's not just about verifying who they are but also that they genuinely fit the criteria for the research. The digital world forever evolves and from my own experience you need to be alert to changes that open the door to fake participants. It needs a joint approach of tech and humans to get the best results. Point 3, absolutely yes! I've been involved in market research for 30 plus years and little has changed whereby researchers rarely value the cost of good quality participant recruitment. There is a distinct difference between market researchers and user researchers, the later valuing the cost of quality recruitment far more. It is vital to have reliable, validated participants for both qual and quant to drive good quality insights..... but it costs.",6,0,1,2mo,Post,Paul Gooding,https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-gooding,,2025-02-10T18:54:55.492Z,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7294762757101400065/,,

🎉 Today, we celebrate the Tond Tenga project in Burkina Faso. This is the first project registered in Verra's Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) Program that uses a VCS methodology approved by The Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM) as meeting the Core Carbon Principles (CCPs).
 
🌳 Developed by Tree Aid with the support of Earthshot, the Tond Tenga project works to restore more than 12,000 hectares of degraded land in Burkina Faso through native tree planting and agroforestry practices.
 
In a region where climate change and deforestation are threatening the landscape and contributing to poverty and hunger, this project is implementing an innovative restoration model to improve soil quality and help local communities cope with increasingly warming temperatures.
 
The income from the sale of carbon credits provides another key benefit that supports the project's long-term impact on the local landscape, the people that inhabit and rely on it, and the global climate.
 
👏🏽 Congratulations to the Tond Tenga project for being a true trailblazer and demonstrating the climate mitigation impact of nature-based solutions.

That’s how someone at COP16 described the vast array of different COPs which seem to have more and more record breaking attendance as we hurtle towards record breaking temperatures.

And it’s easy to fall into the trap of cynicism. It’s true the pure number air miles required to discuss the very clear facts of climactic breakdown can make for easy fodder for the nihilistic view of our current predicament.

But Tree Aid has always offered a pragmatic and optimistic view of proven and scalable action which can solve those issues being debated. We have the tools - we just need to use them.

For my part - this year I attended two out of three COPs. First in Baku and then just now in Riyadh.

What I witnessed was a convergence of smart and able people coming together to learn from each other and push for implementing what we know works at scale. At the same time this group is, more than ever, recognising the power of nature and of indigenous people and local communities. Combining these two forces will undoubtedly be the key which unlocks successful climate action globally.

We’re playing our part at Tree Aid not just in how we deliver large scale, empowering, inclusive and effective programming. We are also bringing vital knowledge to events like COP. This year we launched 3 key pieces of evidence to help accelerate climate solutions:

🌳  Alongside World Economic Forum and 1t.org we launched a paper to show how carbon financing can and should work in the Great Green Wall - and presented our own case study of how we did it in practice. https://lnkd.in/egKW2qzZ
🌳  We brought our on the ground evidence of decades of delivering better forest and land governance to show its value and impact as part of restoration agendas. https://lnkd.in/ehWMqFFY
🌳  In collaboration with Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT we demonstrated the limitations and challenges of inclusive climate finance - and made clear recommendations for improvements for the next NDC process. https://lnkd.in/e4Q_zxVk

We have more reasons to be optimistic than not. With concerted and collaborative efforts, reversing land degradation rates and deforestation rates is possible. At Tree Aid we’ll continue to raise the voice of those on the front line of the climate crisis and we won’t rest until we’ve achieved our mission.

Have a great Christmas everyone!",120,4,10,4mo,Post,Tom Skirrow,https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-skirrow-06a90b36,,2024-12-13T15:00:58.144Z,,,

Great to speak alongside Beverley Gower-Jones OBE FEI, Yvonne Deane Harte and Ingrid Holmes examining what is required to create the optimal enabling environment for cleantech innovations to stay funded through successive rounds and achieve commercialisation and scale. We asked how investors can collectively coordinate and streamline the process by which an innovation moves from Seed to Series A, B, and beyond. The discussion covered: 

1. Demand side dynamics and the role of accelerators and facilities, PPP and others, that can work with the people that have a lab-proven technology and bring them through Pilot to Demo to FOAK, understanding that FOAK is the ultimate goal from the start.

2. Supply side dynamics and the role of concessional capital and the risk-sharing mechanisms that can lower the cost of capital and bring debt into the project sooner.

Ahead of the sessions on the Road to Zero stage, we asked industry leaders what we can expect to hear about sustainable finance.

Listen to what Julie Emmrich (WorldGBC), Roland Hunziker (WBCSD – World Business Council for Sustainable Development) and James Hooton (Green Finance Initiative) have to say in the video below.

Green finance regulations are quickly expanding, and over 50 green EU taxonomies are already in place or being developed.

Yet another OTS Group service van stolen overnight while parked at Travelodge Scunthorpe—and another targeted in an attempted theft. This is not the first time. Last year, we had the same issue at a Premier Inn, and hundreds of businesses have shared similar experiences.

Estimated £5,000–£8,000 losses per incident
No police presence or follow-up
No security improvements by hotels
 ""Vehicles left at owner’s risk""—even in paid parking

This must change. We call for:
 ✅ Travelodge & UK hoteliers to state how they will improve vehicle security.
 ✅ MP for Scunthorpe to raise this growing issue affecting tradespeople.
 ✅ Humberside Police to review response policies for overnight thefts.
Tradespeople, contractors, and SMEs deserve better. We’re amplifying the voices of thousands working hard to support the UK economy—only to be targeted, unsupported & left out of pocket.
If you or your business has faced similar incidents, comment, share & support this message. Let’s push for real action.

Not only did I have a brilliant time with 100 of them at the “Long Lunch” last week…but I had some fascinating conversations too.
 
Artificial Intelligence came up – of course it did – so I decided to do a little experiment.
 
I followed up with 15 of the Agency Leaders I spoke with and asked them about the conversations they’d had throughout the day.
 
Then I took their replies and loaded them into Bard*.

---

Bard gave me this summary:
 
𝗧𝗮𝗹𝗲𝗻𝘁: This word is mentioned 6 times, which suggests that the challenge of finding and retaining talent was a significant challenge for people in 2023.
 
𝗔𝗜: This word is mentioned 5 times, which suggests that the impact of artificial intelligence on the creative industry was a topic of interest.
 
𝗥𝗲𝗰𝗿𝘂𝗶𝘁𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁: This word is mentioned 5 times, which further emphasizes the challenge of finding and retaining talent.
 
𝗚𝗿𝗼𝘄𝘁𝗵: This word is mentioned 4 times, which suggests that despite the challenges, there was still some growth this year.
 
𝗘𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗼𝗺𝘆: This word is mentioned 3 times, which suggests that the economic climate was a factor in the challenges faced by businesses this year.
 
𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: This word is mentioned 3 times, which suggests that building relationships with other agency professionals was seen as an important way to navigate the challenges faced by the industry.

----

That pretty much sums up my recollection of the discussions too. A tough year, but plenty of reasons to be optimistic. 

And just to be clear, no-one thought AI was going to take all the creative industry jobs. There is an expectation it will be disruptive, but not apocalyptic. 
 
Thanks to Susie McFarland for organizing this annual Christmas get together. 
 
*Bard chosen for no particular reason in this case.

They are offering FREE beer mats and posters to pubs, clubs, and bars across the South West of England to help raise awareness of testicular cancer. If you know a venue that might be interested, I've shared the details below 🙌 Thank you so much! 💛

🚨 Attention all pubs, clubs, and bars – and the people who love them! 🍻🎉
April is Testicular Cancer Awareness Month 🎗️, and we’re launching a BRAND NEW campaign to help people learn the signs of testicular cancer and how to spot them.
💡 Will you help by stocking our NEW BEER MATS in your venue? 🍺
The earlier testicular cancer is spotted, the higher the chance of survival—so every single beer mat could literally save a life. ❤️
📩 Email hello@itsinthebag.org.uk and we’ll send you a package.
And if you don’t run a pub but love going to one, please ask them to get involved next time you’re in!

In the last 2 months I’ve had hardly any enquiries or results from any of the Ad campaigns on Facebook etc. 

For the first time in 9 years I’m now debating about getting another part time job. I was really hoping that I could get to the 10 year mark which would be March next year, but at the moment it’s not sustainable. 

I’m not sure what the reason is, I like to think I price my work fairly for the amount of time each piece takes. 
Maybe it’s just the economic climate at the moment? 
Either way, I don’t think my work is being seen enough or by the right people. 

If any of you out there feel the urge to help a girl out by sharing my work, my Instagram @theyachtartist, my website or maybe you might know someone who would be interested in commissioning a painting from me, please help! 😅🙏🏼

I’d love to get to my 10th anniversary!

This Saturday, 21st September, we'll be paddling in the charity Dragon Boat Race in Bristol Harbour for Gympanzees, an extraordinary charity that supports disabled children and young people. Our team consists of the amazing group of: Callum Mcdonnell, Mark Callaghan, Johnny Palmer, Karl Paul, Nick Gracie, Simon Coulson, Simon Agass MSc (FRGS), Sean Suleman, David Telford, Neil Thompson and myself.

We’re a passionate team of 11 (Team Name: Paddle my Ride!), and we’ve set ourselves the challenge of raising £1,000 to help Gympanzees continue their amazing work. Their goal is to create the UK’s first fully inclusive leisure facility for disabled children, a place where no child is left behind.

Being part of this event means a lot to us, and we believe this cause has potential to transform lives, so we’re determined to not only win the competition, but also reach our fundraising target, and with your help, we know we can get there. Whether it’s through donating or simply sharing the message, every bit of support counts! 🙏

You must watch the YouTube video (link below) to find out more. The impact is incredible. 

Check out our JustGiving page (link below) and please donate generously.   Other links have been included to highlight the incredible work that Gympanzees does.  Let’s get behind them and make this project a reality for so many deserving kids.

Thank you for your support—let’s make some waves! 🌊💙

As we enter a brand-new year, we’re reflecting on the incredible growth and change we experienced in 2024. Since starting The Table Creative in 2016, we’ve evolved in many ways. The dedication of our fantastic team and the trust and encouragement from those around us have enabled us to grow alongside the changing needs of our clients. Now, we’re taking the next step in our journey - and it’s a big one!

From January 2025, The Table Creative has become The Rez Group.
This is more than a name change. We’re growing from one brand into three, creating a collective of specialist CGI studios to better serve different industries. While our name evolves, the core of what makes us special, our team, our values, and our dedication to creating incredible work, remains the same.

Let me introduce you to our new brands:

ProRez: A CGI studio dedicated to product-based businesses and manufacturers. Whether it’s beautifully styled interior scenes or professional pack shot environments, we create photorealistic imagery that showcases your products in the best light.

HyRez: A bespoke property CGI brand, crafting photorealistic stills, animations, and interactive imagery that bring developments to life.

This shift is about creating space for our team to excel and grow in exciting new ways while delivering even greater value to our clients through focused expertise to meet the unique needs of different sectors while continuing to provide the high-quality work you know us for. We’re incredibly excited about what’s ahead!

Whether you’ve worked with us, supported us, or followed our journey, thank you for being part of it.

Bridging this gap is what our clients strive to achieve.  Our sales training takes individuals from being 'unconsciously incompetent' That is working hard but not at what the business wants from them.  To achieving the state of being 'unconsciously competent'.  Working 'naturally' on exactly what the business wants.

We even had plans to grow another 220,000 square feet, bringing even more toy production back to America.

But now? Those plans are on hold.
Why? Because with the tariffs, we won’t have the profits—or the capital—to make it happen.

Let’s get real:
Toys are a $40 billion industry.
Apple does $167 billion in the U.S. alone.
We’re not a tech giant—but we create joy, jobs, and innovation right here in America.

If we want to keep American manufacturing alive, the answer is simple:
👉 #KeepToysTariffFree
👉 Support American jobs
👉 Act NOW—before it’s too late.

Please Mr. Trump don't tax children's joy and happiness. Please come and visit our factory in Ohio.

I have 4 kids and many of my LinkedIn friends know a bit about them because I post embarrassing Dad posts on them from time to time. Sorry kids 😔 

Like when my singer/songwriter daughter Jen (artist name NORTH) has success I can’t help but post something to celebrate and share. 

This post though isn’t quite as uplifting, sorry. This is about my eldest daughter that our family often calls ‘the brave one’, Josie. 

Josie had mild eczema from a baby and a severe nut allergy.

But In 2022 she had something altogether much, much worse.

Imagine being allergic to your own hair? Or feeling you’ve been stung like a bee when water drops touch your skin. Not being able to be hugged or to touch another human being for fear of a skin flare akin to a cheese grater ripping up your skin. That’s no exaggeration. 

Every doctor and consultant we saw (and we saw lots) said the same thing, “it’s just severe Eczema, take these steroids”. 
Except she didn’t have eczema. She had the awful, painful effects of Topical Steroid Withdrawal (TSW) from using Steroids on her skin and oral digestion. 

The Big Pharma companies supporting the doctors and consultants said “it’s just a return of your eczema”.

And each time she finished a course of steroids the ‘eczema’ (not!) would return even bigger, more painful and disfiguring. Her skin was dropping off her face. 

After a year of searching for help she put her beautiful but disfigured face and her whole soul on TikTok and …

BOOM!

She went viral. Millions viewed it and thousands of TSW victims came forward; all disfigured and many, many mentally destroyed. All shared their Steroid stories, the resulting TSW and the pain. They continue to do so.

Some have sadly committed suicide due to living with this awful, permanently painful affliction. 

And big Pharma continues to deny it. 

Until now. 

The government is waking up to this. They are aware of it.

Josie wants to go further, faster. She wants to stop this now and gain mass awareness so others never have to go through this. 

Here’s my small ask. Does anyone know a producer, director, filmmaker for Netflix, Channel 4, ITV, BBC or other? She has written her story ‘Breaking the Silence’ and wants to share it. I said I’d ask my LinkedIn friends. God bless, thank you for any contacts.

Yes, WWL is about helping Mums find jobs. But it’s about so much more.

When Camilla and I first started WWL, we were focussed on supporting Mums back into work that would give them economic stability for their families. What we didn’t appreciate then—but have come to realise is EVERYTHING—is the powerful community that’s grown out of it.

The friendships, the stories, the sense of belonging… so many Mums tell us they finally feel part of something. They feel more positive, more supported—and from that foundation, the work begins to follow.

One Mum I met last week shared that she’d been living in a new area for over a year and hadn’t made a single friend. I can’t imagine that kind of loneliness. Within moments, other Mums offered to meet her for coffee. Regardless of her employment outcome, she’s already less alone and that can only make life better in so many ways.

The world might be getting more high-tech by the day, and there's an ace AI tool for so many things. But in the end, it’s the human connection—those face-to-face moments—that are making the biggest difference in getting our Mums back into work.

I absolutely love this video from some of our recent grads....",20,1,2,6d,Post,Rachel Mostyn,https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachelmostyn,,2025-04-29T17:33:41.896Z,,https://dms.licdn.com/playlist/vid/v2/D5605AQHfLK63_ZyGuA/mp4-720p-30fp-crf28/B56ZaCnD5jGkBU-/0/1745948017047?e=1747130400&v=beta&t=IIpqGewcUQGZ8JgGWQO_mh-MINrdFC49oOVt3Q_tBEs,

It is vital to realise the true barriers to work, because poor health and not working are often as a result of wider systemic failures. 

One of the huge barriers to employment is the soaring cost - and limited availability - of childcare. The average cost of a part-time (25 hours a week) nursery place for a child under two in England is £159.61 a week (£8,299.72 a year for 52 weeks). This is up 7.7% from £150.89 a week in 2023. For some, these costs can make it simply unaffordable to work.

Social housing issues and insufficient SEND provision create further barriers for many parents who wish to work. 126,040 households in England are homeless in temporary accommodation – up 16% in a year. Those households with children increased by 15.7% to 80,530.

These overlapping issues are holding many people back from the labour market. 

We work with hundreds of economically inactive Mums who want to work. There's a big role here for specialist organisations to help unpick and address the complex barriers that people face, but there also needs to be an acknowledgment of these other factors that keep many Mums away from employment.

As an organisation, we have also supported Mums on PIPs who want to work. The desire to work is clear but it is also important for employers to recognise these barriers and give everyone a chance.

It is essential that these deep-rooted barriers to employment are tackled.",53,1,6,1mo,Rachel Mostyn reposted this,The Women's Work Lab,https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-women-s-work-lab,,2025-03-18T21:28:48.092Z,,,

So many of the Mums who helped shape WWL told us they felt disconnected from the professional world—like they didn’t belong—simply because they had been away from the workplace for so long.

That’s why today felt so special. A group of our Women's Work Lab Mums attended the fantastic West of England Mayoral Combined Authority Good Employment Charter International Women's Day event at Engine Shed. We heard from inspiring speakers like Lisa Upton from Thought Bubbles and Hazel Hayden from Bristol Menopause & Wellwoman Clinic. I was also delighted to join Kay Howick, FCIPD and Sabrina Shutter for a panel discussion on supporting women returning from maternity leave. Oh, and of course—there was plenty of networking too!

The whole event felt truly inclusive, and the feedback from our Mums was incredible. In our training, we often talk about ‘the shiny offices’ in town—how they can feel intimidating from the outside, like they aren’t spaces for everyone. But today was proof that wherever you are on your journey back to work, professional spaces should belong to us all.

We're also making history as the first-ever co-winners, which feels so The Women's Work Lab- our job share status being recognised at such a high level is amazing. 💪

This prize is a little different from others. It’s not just about celebrating our work; it’s a monetary award specifically for our own professional development. The idea is to grow ourselves so we can grow our impact. Plus, we’re getting incredible support from the Cambridge Centre for Social Innovation, Cambridge Judge Business School & Trinity Hall, which is proving invaluable.

So far, we’ve been doing some executive coaching with the brilliant Suzy Stollery MA FCIPD from Beside Ltd. Having a mix of joint and individual coaching has been a game-changer, especially as we head into this exciting phase of national growth. We also recently did The PRINT® Survey, which digs into personality types, motivations, and behaviors. I’ve never done anything like it before—it was SO eye-opening. What we discovered is that the magic of our partnership isn’t just a feeling; it’s an actual real thing. We’re so different, yet our strengths and development areas balance each other out perfectly. It has given us loads to think about in how we can keep bringing out the best in each other. Honestly, it’s such a joy to do all this alongside someone I care about so so much 💛

Whether it’s supporting people to retrain mid-career or helping young people take their first steps into work, our research shows that meaningful employment often requires the right support at the right time.

Through our evaluations, we work closely with employers, policymakers, and participants to ensure that skills, training, and employment programmes truly meet the needs of the individual, the wider workforce and employers. Recent projects have explored:
🔹 Mid-career transitions. Our evaluation of Working Wales Career Reviews examined how tailored support helps jobseekers retrain and find new opportunities. https://lnkd.in/dqkKK_Yp 
🔹 Youth employment. Our research into the Jobs Growth Wales Programme highlighted the wraparound support needed to help young people thrive in work. https://lnkd.in/e6X9y_x3

When planning a Management Buyout (MBO) or Management Buy-In (MBI), most attention goes to valuation, funding, and deal structure. But what about the risks after the ink is dry?
That's where Warranties & Indemnities (W&I) insurance plays a crucial role.
📉 Without proper cover, buyers may inherit unknown liabilities — and sellers could be exposed to claims long after exit.
🔒 W&I insurance protects both sides:
✅ Sellers gain a cleaner exit with reduced post-deal liability
✅ Buyers are safeguarded from financial surprises
✅ Deals move faster with fewer legal disputes
In Session 4 of the GJC MBO/MBI Academy, we unpack the legal and tax landscape of MBOs/MBIs — including how to use insurance to de-risk your transaction and protect your legacy.
📚 If you’re preparing to exit your business or advising someone who is, make sure risk mitigation is part of the plan.

Too many deals are derailed because expectations aren’t aligned between owners, management teams, and funders.
🔍 Here’s what you need to know:
Valuation isn’t just a number — it's a story about future earnings, market position, and perceived risk.
EBITDA multiples, adjusted earnings, and growth potential play key roles in determining value for MBO/MBI purposes.
Independent valuation advice is critical—emotions and personal attachments can cloud judgement.
Structuring matters — How much is paid upfront versus deferred can drastically change the deal dynamics.
💡 Getting your valuation right ensures you don’t leave value on the table—or scare off your own management team with unrealistic numbers.
At the GJC MBO/MBI Academy, we break down the key valuation principles you need to understand, giving you and your management team the confidence to approach negotiations fairly and strategically.
📚 Thinking about an MBO/MBI? Make sure you know your true value.

Recently, GJC Advisory partnered with a family-owned holiday park in the South West who were so consumed with daily operations that there was no space to plan for the future.
Using our MAUS platform, we conducted a full business review—covering operations, finance, marketing, people management, and governance. Our findings paved the way for installing a brand-new Senior Leadership Team (SLT) including a Head of Operations, Marketing Manager, Head of Finance, and Head of People and Culture.
✅ Better governance and board communication
✅ Owner-directors freed up to think strategically (or simply enjoy more family time)
✅ A strong platform for multi-generational ownership, without needing to work through to retirement
Today, the park is thriving with professional leadership in place and a secure, sustainable future for generations to come.

4️⃣ Openly Roadmap PX opportunities. Take the improvement areas surfaced in step 1️⃣ and build a roadmap of opportunity areas to elevate PX. Make it open. 

5️⃣ Build in Public as a people team. Document and share your journey, builds, project progress. This is the most authentic content you could every craft when it comes to PX.

From mixing our own colours, and applying them (often pretty randomly) over the stencils it was all about focusing on, and trusting, the process. The results were vibrant, beautiful and unexpected, and we all got such a buzz from it. 🥳

Our focus is to use the learning to develop a community support pathway for prevention - picking up on the main triggers to hospital admission for older people and shaping the conversation and the offer to delay/prevent as much as we can. Working as part of an integrated neighbourhood team presents an opportunity to embed this pathway and community support generally, as a mainstream approach - rather than something we just call on to help with discharge.

It’s big, and blue-coloured with gold stars. It also has a name - the EU Mobility Package. Which is an odd name for an elephant, but don’t be fooled... it’s still potentially a jumbo headache for transport operators.
 
Whilst we’re leaving the EU proper in a matter of weeks, under the transition agreement, regulations that come into force before December 31st have to be adopted into UK law. The Mobility Package is one of them, so our EU elephant will shortly be wearing the Union flag.

While most of the package deals with international journeys, it also calls for enforcement of a piece of regulation which will have the greatest domestic impact - EU562/2014 Article 36 & 34. 

Basically, all drivers are now required to have a full 28 days records of all activity and inactivity for each and every day on their digi-card. For periods when the driver is away from the vehicle, these need to be input manually prior to commencing their next period of driving. Fine if this is just a daily or weekly rest - but a huge pain in the proverbials for occasional drivers.

So, not quite the early Christmas present drivers might be looking for, but one that I can help them with to ensure a happier new year...

Transport Managers checking to ensure that their drivers are undertaking Daily Defect Checks correctly should be commonplace. The DVSA Guide to Maintaining Roadworthiness states, 'a way of monitoring the quality of the daily check is to have a visiting agent or competent in-house member of staff re-examine the vehicle as it leaves or enters the operating centre. The inspection result can be checked against the driver's defect reports to ensure the driver's check is of sufficient quality.'

I believe more Transport Managers should ensure defect checks are not just a tick box exercise as that potentially puts dangerous vehicles on the road.",22,5,2,4yr,Post,Ian Dodd,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianjdodd,,2020-10-08T14:48:11.774Z,,,

Sunhouse is now BCorp™ Certified and we are a member of 1% for the Planet®

When we set Sunhouse up, in a tiny attic in 2008, we were determined to create an agency that above all had positivity running through its veins. Yes we had aspirations to work with great brands, yes we were determined to create great work, but from the outset we were insistent that that had to be done in our own, positively different way.

Now a team of 40 amazing people with a rich and diverse network of clients, we have far more responsibility and far more pressure, so keeping that positive Sunhouse culture alive is more important now than it ever has been. But how do we do that? It can’t just be pool tables, Labradors, free ice cream and the odd beer, it has to run far deeper than that.

A few years ago we joined a global Climate march. Taking to the streets in our hometown of Bath we beat our drums (actually an upturned canoe) and our team created amplification stations, making live posters for the marchers so they could get their protest heard. With the whole agency involved the positive buzz from that day still resonates now. It was culturally way more powerful than any party we’ve had, and we have had some parties.

Last year we rebranded Work For Good, a beautiful team of people who are making a real difference, working their socks off to help businesses raise money for charities they care about (look these guys up – they are awesome!). For the team at Sunhouse the experience of working to create something effective, for great people and a great cause, further deepened the positivity running through the agency.

So what’s next? We are very excited to announce that we are BCorp™ certified and have become a member of 1% for the Planet®.

As many of you will know B Corp™ certification measures a company’s entire social and environmental impact. With certification we become part of a global movement of companies who are pushing for change and who prioritise the environment and society in the way they do business. It doesn’t stop here, in 3 years we’ll be tested again, so it is now up to us to improve on our score and keep pushing to be better.

On our BCorp™ journey we learnt about 1% for the Planet®, an alliance of businesses who understand the necessity of protecting the natural environment. We will donate 1% of our gross sales (regardless of profit) to some of the thousands of environmental partners tackling the planet’s most pressing environmental issues. When we all work together, 1% adds up.

I think there’s an outdated sense in business that if you want to make money you have to somehow compromise your values, but we’re discovering with initiatives like B Corp™ and 1% for the Planet®, and by working with great people, clients and partners that it doesn’t have to be that way. We can use business as a force for good and that is the simplest way to keep our special brand of positivity alive.

It may require a makeover in the form of a re-line.

Old and aging boreholes can suffer from corrosion, steel casing installed all thoughs years ago could be past there life span and allowing unwanted surface groundwater to enter your borehole, this could not only effect water quality, it can allow cascading water in the borehole which can lead to iron bacteria breeding and clogging up you borehole.

Drilcorp have an answer, rather than drill a new borehole, if you have a large enough diameter you can re-line your borehole. 

There are various methods to cover most diameters and materials,
At Drilcorp we have the Experiance to handle all.

So if we see talent, we want to help.
 
Three years ago, we decided to switch-up our internships programme to create the Epoch Academy. 
 
It’s all about giving people a chance. 
 
Our Academy exists to springboard the next generation of talent - across design, motion, copywriting, brand strategy and beyond – nurturing both the future superstars of the industry and those who haven’t yet had the opportunity (or the luxury) to explore their career options fully.
 
Much more than an internship program, Epoch Academy offers paid placements packed with enriching creative experiences.
 
We’re here open doors and minds. To broaden horizons - yours and ours. To challenge and inspire. And to have a laugh along the way.
 
For a chance to earn your placement, you’ll need to join an Epoch Academy Workshop. The next one is on 26th April 2024. Applications are still open. So if you’re interested, or know someone who might be, apply now. https://lnkd.in/etbPdnkW",98,3,23,1yr,Theron Bigland reposted this,Epoch,https://www.linkedin.com/company/epoch-design,,2024-03-11T12:40:12.788Z,,,

This is why we’ve created Sustainable Futures, an introductory virtual programme for our customers to learn more about sustainable living. The sessions have been developed as part of our Greenoak Centre of Excellence initiative.
 
Each session, delivered by a member of Stonewater’s retrofit and sustainability teams, or an external expert such as fuel poverty charity National Energy Action, covers topics such as understanding how global warming and greenhouse gases effect housing.
 
Participants have also been learning about energy efficiency, emissions, fuel poverty and EPC ratings.

Diving in as the newly appointed CEO of automotive brand Bonetti was daunting enough when every decision counts, but the healthy dose of competitiveness as the weeks went on actually became pretty fun... Thanks Mark Ritson! The course gave me new perspectives on leadership, strategy and innovation with a highlight being decision analysis with Yael Grushka-Cockayne. I’m excited to apply these insights as I step back into my role.

Balancing professional growth with a new chapter in life wasn’t easy. But it helped me feel myself when at points I felt anything but. A big thank you to Josh Nesfield FRSA who supported me along the way.

For anyone considering upskilling during a career break—whether maternity leave or otherwise—I’d highly recommend it and the Mini MBA. Luckily I could listen and learn whilst pacing around the park with a sleeping baby!

Would love to hear from others who’ve navigated learning alongside big life changes. How did you find it?

Our table discussions covered everything from our shared challenges to how a new business process can be better embedded across the business.

For me, where agencies can be overly reliant on leadership to drive new business, investing in a strong and consistent marketing and sales process combined with team training and inclusion sets up the wider agency to support with agency growth.

I've been a bit quiet on here, but I'm back and I'm SO excited to announce that the doors to Bond of the Brave are OFFICIALLY OPEN 🙌
 
I launched Bond of the Brave back in July, although then it was Fearless Female Academy (we had to rebrand because of a trademark infringement 🙈). 

It is born out of my passion to raise children to be their best selves, but that has to start with us. Bond of the Brave is a membership site with 2 objectives; to live confidently and to be braver today than we were yesterday 👊

Each month our members get: a monthly masterclass with an incredible expert, a physical book chosen by the expert and posted to you by us, a challenge, a live Q&A with the expert and an INCREDIBLE COMMUNITY ❤️

I believe, with every bone in my body, that we already have everything we need inside of us to the confident, brave and incredible individuals that we are truly created to be, we just have to find it!

2020 has been a rollercoaster of a year but how we end 2020 is key to how we will show up in 2021 👊. The doors close at 10pm on Thursday 22nd October.

If you are anything like the Jo that went through school, uni and a large proportion of the last 5 years then it's likely that:
🙋‍♀️ you're scared of being judged by others
🙋‍♀️ you don't think you're smart enough to figure it out
🙋‍♀️you want more from your life

But the thing is you already have everything inside of you to live your BEST LIFE, you just have to build your confidence and BELIEVE IN YOURSELF 👊

Within FFA we will work on the 5 pillars of confidence; foundations, body, self, career and life.

We will build foundations so strong that even when our confidence is knocked and we fall down, we GET BACK UP.

We will grow our confidence together, as a community, so that when we face fear, we move through it.

The July Masterclass is focusing on foundations of confidence pillar. ""You cannot build your house on sand and expect it to withstand the storm.""

Being a Fearless Female and living our best life is the name of this life changing, long game that we’re playing 🙌

Doors close at 10pm TONIGHT (Tuesday 7 July) and once they're closed. They're closed.

- have a niggling feeling that you are intended for more, but lack the courage to go for it. 
- are scared of judgement if you try.

What if I told you that:
- you ALREADY have the courage inside of you
- other people’s opinions of us are none of our business
- together we can bring the change. 

Since launching Freckles Childcare 5 years ago, ONE thing that has remained consistent throughout is that I have to BELIEVE IN MYSELF.

Believing in yourself requires confidence and confidence (for me) is defined by 5 pillars; foundations, body, self, career and life.

I have spent the past 5 years building on my confidence so that I show up fearlessly.

I am NOT fearless all of the time but on the days when I fall down my foundations of confidence are so strong that I get BACK UP again and I carry on.

On Wednesday night I opened the doors to Fearless Female academy 🙌 where members will move from low self-belief to CONFIDENCE. Where together we will show up as the FEARLESS FEMALES we are truly meant to be.

For us at Carbon Kind, it starts by putting local communities at the heart of carbon projects.

We’re developing high-integrity, certified carbon initiatives in West Africa -  from clean cookstove distribution and borehole rehabilitation, to regenerative biochar farming. 

Every project is community-led, transparent, and designed to deliver measurable social and environmental impact.

By supporting our work, partners are not only reducing or removing carbon, they’re:
- Restoring ecosystems
- Increasing access to safe water
- Empowering women and smallholder farmers
- Driving climate justice

We’re building a better model for offsetting – one rooted in trust, transparency, and transformation.

If you're a carbon consultant or sustainability lead looking for ethical, traceable credits, I’d love to connect and hear how you're thinking about quality and integrity in this space.

For a long time, I believed carbon credits were just about offsetting emissions, and, to be honest, I wasn't sure if they were truly beneficial. But my journey has shown me they can be genuinely transformative when done right.

Through our projects, like restoring boreholes and distributing fuel-efficient cookstoves in rural Togo, I’ve seen firsthand how ethical carbon credits create powerful change, not just for the climate, but for the lives of real people in communities that have contributed the least yet are impacted the most by climate change.

These initiatives don't simply cut carbon, they provide families with safe water, healthier homes, and pathways out of poverty. When communities drive the solutions, the outcomes are more resilient, equitable, and genuinely transformative.

Real change happens when we focus on lasting, community led, climate projects 🌱

Although it's difficult, conversations like today, with a varied and informed group of stakeholders will help to move the dial.

At times it gave me a sense of hopelessness, as the impacts of agricultural industrialisation are described in brutal first-hand detail. Decimation of rural communities and nature, all greatly accelerated during my lifetime. And all set in the global context of needing to find a way to continue to feed 8 billion people.

But the hopelessness turned to hopefulness, as a method is laid out for managing a landscape in a balanced way, to allow nature and agriculture to flourish together. It's not perfect. And compromise and collaboration is required. But it is possible to do things differently and break the mould of: “more, cheaper, faster”.

I was mid-way through reading this when the DEFRA Landuse Consultation was launched last week, which was timely. This should be on a compulsory reading list for anyone involved.

Finally met the great Jess Staufenberg after many emails to arrange a visit to our wonderful school- although neither of us recognised each other until the end! (Was a bit early!) Thank you Kay Burley at Sky News for hosting our discussion this morning on the Labour policy to add VAT to education possibly as early as January 2025.

There is such strength of feeling for both sides of the argument and I totally get it- education in the UK needs to get its act together and bring well qualified teachers into the classroom and ensure children are in school to benefit from this expertise. Seeing the posts that are coming through on twitter, there is still fierce debate and this policy was one of the most heated debates during the election period. 

It's a done deal but what happens next counts. 

You can't throw money at a problem and hope it fixes it. You also can't throw money at a problem when you don't have the expected revenue from a policy and the consequences could have disastrous effects on the education of children, both state and independent as well as the public purse.

I'm an advocate of working together to provide the best for every child.

But volunteer schemes can be costly or difficult to integrate into working life.

Our mentoring programme is different. It’s flexible, fulfilling, and free, making it an ideal option for businesses looking to achieve their social impact goals - while helping employees develop valuable skills and boost their well-being.

So how can mentoring fit into busy working lives? Easily!

✅ Flexible – Mentors choose when and where they volunteer. Sessions are just 1–2 hours a week and can fit into the working day.

✅ No additional costs – We cover training costs, provide expenses, and offer ongoing support.

✅ Meaningful – Mentoring is hugely rewarding, develops transferable skills, and improves well-being.

If you’d like to volunteer or explore how your business can get involved, we’d love to hear from you!

As we mark the 20th anniversary of Practicus this month, we're filled with gratitude and a sense of accomplishment. It's been two decades since we embarked on our mission to help organisations and people navigate through the complexities of business change. This year, we celebrate not just the journey but the successes, challenges and invaluable experiences we've encountered along the way. 

This anniversary is a testament to the dedication of our teams and interims, the trust of our clients and the collaborative spirit that runs through all the work we undertake. 

We'll be commemorating the occasion in a number of ways over the coming weeks but today we're sharing some of the moments from our birthday celebrations on Friday.

As we look to the future, we're excited for what's next. With the same passion and purpose that have guided us for two decades, we're ready to face new challenges, embrace opportunities and continue making a difference in the lives of those we work with.

Here's to 20 years of Practicus, and to many more years of making change work for everyone. Thank you to everyone who's been part of our story - here's to continuing the journey together!

(Particular Thank Yous to Sam Hawkins and Dave Kemble for running an excellent Practicus quiz, Philly Wallin for the Practicus catch-phrase bingo, Darren Tolhurst for the Practicus awards and to everyone involved in making Friday so special, not least Paul Wandless, Boyd Kershaw and Jason Luckhurst for founding this amazing business.)

For that reason, I am very proud of the whole Practicus team who came first in this year’s Institute of Interim Management (IIM) Survey. Every year for the last six years we have risen up the table, reaching second place last year and third the year before. I think it’s worth taking a moment to say what a herculean effort that is given the strength of the competition and the lengths the IIM goes to in ensuring the survey remains the industry standard for excellence. Team I salute you! And I want to thank everyone who participated in this year’s survey, nearly 3,000 interim managers all told. 

The next part is the hardest of all, taking the quality of our services still further to better meet the needs of the market while continuing to adapt to the challenges that life throws our way. Given how everyone here adjusted during the lockdown, I feel re-assured that the people at Practicus are up to the task.

I am experiencing repetitive diesel particulate filter faults with a JLR approved Land Rover Discovery Sport, I purchased in September 23. 

💩 8 weeks into ownership there was an issue with the O2 sensor. I contacted JLR Assist as I had concerns I might breakdown either on a motorway or on a rural road to get to my horses. I was told my vehicle would be safe to drive. Jardine Slough who I purchased the vehicle from were not accepting recoveries until January 24!?! So I reluctantly booked the appointment for the New Year. 

💩 25th December Christmas Day- my car went into limp mode, it was unsafe to drive due to loss of power. I then struggled between the dealership and JLR Assist to get the vehicle recovered, no one would take responsibility as to whose responsibility it was to recover the vehicle to the dealer. 🤦🏻‍♀️ Phone call after phone call, I managed to get the car recovered. 

💩 The DPF needed to be replaced which Jardine Slough undertook under warranty apparently but if I read my warranty document it’s not covered. The part was on back order so it was the end of February before I could collect my repaired vehicle.

💩 Then at the end of April, the DPF on my vehicle failed again. Yet again a struggle to find a JLR dealership to recover the vehicle to, this time it ended up at Grange Hatfield. Unfortunately, they wanted to charge me £3.5k to undertake repairs…

💩 My car has been at the dealership since the end of April, I have refused to pay for the repair and I have asked why the DPF would have failed again. Apparently my driving style 🤣🫣🫣

💩 Mid-September 24, a phone call “good news, my DPF is going to be replaced FOC”. It’s now November, I still don’t have my car as the part is now on back order. 😬🤦🏻‍♀️

💩 I have had to buy, tax and insure another vehicle for the 6 months while I have waited for JLR and there is no end in sight. 

The purpose of my post is that I hope anyone planning to purchase a JLR vehicle makes a very considered decision, knowing that for a premium priced brand their treatment of customers is pretty 💩💩💩. Then the product itself is not fit for purpose. 

The LinkedIn posts I see Adrian Mardell CEO of JLR demonstrates how deluded and arrogant they truly are as an organisation towards their customers. He also ignores me which is also the stance of the JLR dealership network when I question the quality and integrity of their product. 🤣🤣

Thank you for enduring my lengthy post, feel free to share far and wide….

As a small business owner, so far this year, we have seen significant rises in:
⬆ Rent
⬆ Service Charge
⬆ Utilities

And as a business that works with small businesses and is heavily reliant on them being able to invest and recruit, I would be interested to know how a 2% rise in NI contribution for employers will help with growth.

Lets not forget, this is not a 2% rise in cost, it is a 15% rise in that cost for a business.

The nature of community events is you put in months of organising and staff time and potentially zero people walk through the door. Lucille and I were so proud to bring lots of different groups and activities to our Greenway Centre to platform the community action in Southmead 😊 

We had Southmead's first seed swap with support from the Bristol Seed Swap team.
We launched Southmead Repair Cafe (last Saturday of the month going forward!) with sewists, electrical fixers, and bike repairs.
We talked to people about how to make Southmead's homes more energy efficient and affordable.
We shared soup, welsh cakes, falafel, sushi, and curry made by residents.
Meadows to Meaders gathered new stories for future scripts. 
Our monthly market showcased local makers.
And Men's Space shared their crafts of garden benches and bird boxes.

Just a real lush vibe with lots of new visitors. Want to uplift all my colleagues who supported us in the build up and on the day! 🙌

The compliance and risk landscape is evolving rapidly, and it’s fascinating to see how these changes are shaping the skills that top compliance professionals need to succeed.

💠 AI & Automation – It’s not just about being tech-savvy anymore; it’s about understanding how to harness AI to work smarter, handle data faster, and navigate the ethical challenges that come with it.
💠 Cybersecurity – With cyber threats becoming more sophisticated, candidates who can collaborate with IT teams to stay one step ahead are absolutely essential.
💠 Proactive Risk Management – Strong analytical skills and the ability to think ahead are now critical. It’s all about predicting what’s next and preparing for it.
💠 Transparency & Ethics – Compliance is more than following regulations, it’s about building trust and aligning with the bigger picture of brand integrity. MiFID II’s focus on investor protection and transparency highlights just how crucial these skills are in today’s market.

As a specialist recruiter in Risk and Compliance and passionate about connecting top talent with these opportunities, I’m always looking for candidates with the skills and mindset to tackle these emerging challenges. 

Are these the top skills to watch, or are there more?

Matthew Church and I started MAKE in 2013 from scratch. Against advice from pretty much everyone, at the start of 2015, with a new mortgage, newborn sons and a good head of hair, I took the decision to ditch the security of safe employment to take MAKE full-time.

Now MAKE celebrates 10 years of service 😀 .

A trait shared by both Matt and I is the desire to always be better. Whilst this drive has helped ensure MAKE is here a decade later, it does mean we are not the best at reflecting on “success”. So affording ourselves just a brief moment to look back, I have explored what 10 years of MAKE looks like in numbers.

In 2013 I scribbled down a list of values I wanted MAKE to live by. One of these was to “deliver an experience that matches the end product.” As we reflect on the past and plan the next 10 years of MAKE, I have spent some time looking at how we balance this value with growing MAKE.

Almost from the day we started we were asked about establishing MAKE in London. To date this is something we have fought against, as we were concerned that over-extending our reach would compromise both the experience and product we deliver. However, our move last year into Devon and with Rob Shipp MCIOB now 18 months in, we are now in a position to grow beyond our traditional south-west base.

To that end, as part of our 10 years celebrations, I'm happy to confirm we are now opening a new London base in addition to our Bristol and Devon teams. This move will help deliver an even better experience for our projects and clients in and around London.

But that’s not all.

MAKE is not your typical building company and we are always challenging the best way to deliver a project. We are really excited about our new venture coming soon, which will bring the MAKE experience and process to the wider industry. Keep your eyes open for further details in the days and weeks ahead.

Here’s to the next 10 years.",59,9,0,1w,Post,Michael Teeling,https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-teeling-6aa5363b,,2025-04-30T08:40:42.694Z,,,

As Founders, Matthew Church and I, made the decision earlier this year to take the next step in MAKE's growth and look to reinforce our leadership team. This summer we managed to bring the fantastic Rob Shipp MCIOB into the business. Rob has been brought on as a Director with responsibility for overseeing the build operations of our business and has been a great appointment.

Now we are looking to take the next step and support Rob with the appointment of a Commercial Manager, to oversee all commercial aspects of our build operations. This is a great opportunity for someone of the same quality and outlook as Rob to join our business for the long term.

This isn’t going to be an appointment made purely on experience, the key for Matt and I is to find someone who can demonstrate an absolute belief in MAKE’s vision to be different, to be better, to work on interesting projects and to be a great place to work.

From my personal experience, I always had the belief that the construction industry could be better. If you think the same and believe you can make a difference, we would love to hear from you.

We have celebrated our 17th birthday, and saw the amount of money we have raised on behalf of our 60+ charity partners exceed £155 million in first year income – something we are really proud of!!

We have also continued to undertake our own fundraising challenges and charity support, which in the last 17 years has seen Ethicall gift over £1.425 million back to the sector! 

Adding to this, last month Ethicall’s founding Directors headed to India to undertake a 350KM cycle challenge, raising vital funds for the charity Frank Water. The challenge saw us joining a team to cycle through rural areas of central India, seeing some amazing scenery and people along the way, with the highlight of getting to see the fantastic work and projects of Frank Water first hand!

Here’s to 2025, to more successful fundraising for our amazing charity clients and to continuing Ethicall’s support of the sector. We’re looking forward to seeing what exciting challenges and opportunities 2025 will hold!

Some feedback:
We first got to know the management team of back in March 2021 when we put the M&E contract out for tender with a view to start or renew the contract in September 2021, Cosgrove and Drew provided a professional approach throughout the tender process of the contract, for which they were awarded.

At the presentation for the contract the company introduced many ideas for Improvement, one of which was asset tagging which has been actively rolled out across all sites allowing for full PPM servicing delivery and traceability. This is one of many examples of them following through on their commitments to the trust, their engineers and supply chain partners are equally as professional which has created a really strong working relationship at all levels within a short space of time.

The company goes above and beyond the contract scope (reported by all site team members), readily offering knowledge and experience to help on day to day challenges and recommends solutions in line with the trust budgets.

The critical importance of these systems is matched only by their complexity and power. They must be designed within a tight framework of rules to be as light, efficient, powerful and fast as possible. And this is done with a fluid pressure equal to, or perhaps even greater than that which is likely to have crushed the Titan submersible on its final undersea journey. 
 
This is engineering on the edge, and it makes the job of maintaining these systems at a peak level of performance very demanding.

This material was chosen for its exceptional qualities, including a tensile strength of up to 2,000 MPa (290 ksi) and high toughness with elongation at break up to 10%. Maraging steel's low carbon content ensures good machinability and the ability to be cold-rolled up to 90% without cracking. Furthermore, its good weldability allows for small and complex designs without compromising durability and strength.

With heat treatment, maraging steel experiences minimal dimensional change, enabling machining to final dimensions. The high alloy content provides high hardenability, forming ductile FeNi martensites upon cooling, leading to non-existent or negligible cracks. Additionally, these steels can be nitrided for increased case hardness and polished for a fine surface finish, while offering moderate corrosion resistance and resilience to stress corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement. 

The versatility of additive manufacturing allows us to easily make design modifications and seamlessly transition to the manufactured part, ensuring our customers receive valves tailored to their system's specific requirements.

The event was a chance for QAA staff to meet and greet each other, welcome new faces, hear inspiring talks from our leadership teams and collaborate on project planning and culture creation exercises.
 
Topics explored across talks and workshops included enhancing opportunities for internal and external collaboration, dynamically responding to the needs of the HE sector, QAA's strategic direction for 2025, fostering and maintaining a supportive workplace culture, and embedding sustainable working practices across the organisation.

We loved the opportunity to get together and exchange ideas in person, and feel motivated for an exciting year ahead! As one colleague put it: 'The buzz from all the groups working in the one room I found to be really energising.'

Our goal was to promote self-care and wellness, and create something that everyone could get involved with. 

The week consisted of a few different things: 

📆 A wellbeing calendar with daily suggestions for people to try, ranging from mindfulness exercises to healthy habits and positive actions. 
🔈 A speaker session with the wonderful Kat Thorne who shared her story and how one small habit can change your day. I’m looking forward to the follow up session in a few weeks.
💚 A ‘get to know us’ drop in session with our trained Mental Health First Aiders. A chance to get to know them, find out more about mental health first aid and what that support can look like. 
☕️ A ‘Positivity-tea’ catch up, open to all, where the only rule is: we focus on positive things! We are hoping this will become a monthly thing. 
💬 A Wellbeing Teams channel for sharing ideas, photos and general chit chat - which is so important when working remotely.

I loved doing something different that encouraged prioritising my own mental and physical health, and that of those around me. I’m looking forward to doing more in this area in the coming months 🙂

We honestly had no idea how popular and successful it would become. With a huge amount of hard work, passion and dedication we have grown a network of 50 franchisees in the UK and Ireland alongside our newest franchisees in Dubai and Canada, not forgetting our amazing 250 plus teachers and administrators across the network! These very special people collectively, alongside our head office team & wonderful customers, make our Turtle Tots community 😍

Additionally, the scaffold was engineered to laterally support a passenger hoist up to a height of 25 meters. The entire structure reached a height of 30 meters, topped with a temporary roof for weather protection.
Our design featured a sophisticated array of plan braces and structural transoms to transfer axial loads into the tower.

If you’ve ever wondered what the inside of a hot water cylinder looks like then here’s a fine example as to why they should be inspected annually. 

Vast amounts of scale build up in hot water cylinders. 

This reduces efficiency, increases utility costs but most significantly, provides a lovely environment for bacteria such as Legionella to thrive in. Prevention is better than cure so a well maintained water softener will prevent the scale from forming.

At a large commercial building managed by one of our clients, we were engaged to identify and resolve the reasons for high gas consumption. The boilers were running 24/7 at high temperatures, even in summer months. This led to a significant increase in gas consumption. ETS then dialled in remotely and investigated possible reasons for the boilers staying on constantly. We made remote changes to the boiler control and time schedules and optimised the setpoints over a few days. To ensure these savings remain long-term, we also visited the site to check the boiler control loop strategy and amended this where required. During this visit, we noticed some failed room sensors were linked to the boiler control, leading to the boilers going into frost condition unnecessarily. We removed these sensors, so expect further savings following the on-site changes.

Energy and Carbon reduction🌱
• There has been a 49% saving between pre- and post-energy consumption. Estimate of 3x weeks before and 3x weeks after.
• The avoided consumption was a 68% saving, equivalent to £6,300+ over the first 25 days. For this calculation, we compared the actual and expected consumption using heating degree days (now we are in the winter period).

At 100th Monkey, we are proud of the incredible women who make our company what it is - driving impact, supporting one another, and continuously growing. 

We also take immense pride in the many female leaders and team members we’ve had the privilege to train and support. Every week, we help women build their influence, communicate with confidence, and make a lasting impact in their workplaces. Their success is our success, and their leadership makes the world of work better for everyone.

To all the women we work with - inside and outside our company - thank you for your strength, your ambition, and your dedication to lifting others as you rise.

Trainees said they loved the objective feedback and being able to see tangible steps to progress their communication skills. 

Since then we have continued to seek ways to unlock the science of speaking, and it has been a long held desire to develop an AI tool that we trusted could generate accurate data, align to our frameworks, and complement our way of thinking.

It was a month packed with our clients’ goal setting workshops, annual kick-off meetings, big stage presentations, whole-function trainings … and a surprising number of 100th Monkey trips to Munich. From what we heard from many clients, it felt like a long month... And it’s certainly been a busy one for us! 

Our highlights:
✅ Facilitating conversations between leaders and teams to underscore the importance of h͟e͟a͟l͟t͟h͟y, high performing teams in 2025
✅ Running a new virtual programme for medical field teams across east, central and west coast USA
✅ Our most ambitious standalone training yet – sharpening the question handling skills of 71 delegates, in six languages, with every delegate role-playing, recorded, played back, and coached … in three hours! A stellar team performance (pictured)
✅ Supercharging leaders’ big stage presentation skills for their all-company kick off meeting through bespoke workshops to refine their content and delivery style
✅ A storytelling masterclass in beautiful Bavaria (pictured), where delegates learned storytelling structures and tools to enhance their impact and influence, and evidence their work with greater power

What a start to the new year!

Really great to get a boomsatsuma mention at Bristol24/7's amazing job on the central Bristol hustings this week. Doing the right thing in an increasingly troubled world can be very challenging, but the vocal support from our national representatives is really encouraging, not just for the great team at boomsatsuma but also the incredible young people some from our most marginalised communities that study with us and are seeking to make an active and positive contribution to the creative industries.

It was great to see we even garnered some cross party support from Samuel P. S. Williams the conservative candidate celebrating boomsatsuma support from Ed Rowberry and BBRC. as ""A model from Bristol that needs to be shared nationally.""

We had the pleasure of hosting a visit from Thangam to our Creative Technology centre and one of the students commented afterwards that she wasn't what they expected from a politician as ""she actually seemed to be interested in what they thought.""

Our aim? To double the number of people we support within the next five years.

Currently, we know we’re only supporting about a third of those needing end of life care, but we want to do more. As our community grows and diversifies, we must adapt to meet the increasing demand and needs of our patients. Recent years have certainly been challenging, but we’re now focused on an ambitious plan to help us reach and support more people, for longer. Driven by research and stakeholder feedback, our strategy has three areas of focus: 

- Putting communities at the heart of our work, 
- Normalising conversations about death and dying, 
- Leading, learning and innovating.

We've also given our brand a refresh, something we haven’t done in over a decade. Research showed us there were many barriers to people accessing our support or donating to us, but our modernised look helps breaks down misconceptions about St Peter’s, which will help us connect with more of our local communities and increase donations.

Ultimately, our strategy is crucial for helping us achieve our vision of transforming the experience of death through understanding, compassion and care. Death is an inevitable part of life, affecting everyone, but with the right support, we can make it more dignified, comfortable, and aligned with people’s wishes.",72,8,9,1w,Post,Susan Hamilton,https://www.linkedin.com/in/susan-hamilton-b8045816,,2025-05-01T07:39:52.756Z,https://www.stpetershospice.org/about-us/who-we-are/our-strategy/,,

We are really grateful for this funding. This is capital funding and St Peter's Hospice, Bristol use it to pay for essential maintenance of our hospice buildings and IT systems. 

The remaining £75 million will be given out in the next financial year and we look forward to receiving our allocation to support our capital investment program. 

Longer term the hospice sector needs a sustainable funding solution. Many hospices have already cut services and financial pressures will continue to mount, particularly with the additional tax following changes in national insurance. 

We welcome the ongoing discussions the sector is having with government on a sustainable funding solution. Hospices are delivering on government priorities for avoiding hospital admissions and improving community care. It is vital that this continues and is adequately funded.

Sean has led the business from an early-stage start-up, just 4 years ago, to becoming a key player in the UK’s efforts to develop its own lithium and battery metals supply chain. There have been many challenges along the way, and under Sean’s leadership the company has always been able to respond with agility – one of our company’s core values.

As we worked through the latest iteration of our strategy to develop large-scale lithium refining capability, it became clear that we needed to adjust the team to focus on our near-term objectives, resulting in changes across the organisation. We’re confident that these changes will result in Green Lithium being further able to deliver shareholder value and play its role in the emerging UK and broader European battery market.

Sean said, “It is with mixed emotions that I’m leaving not only Green Lithium but also leaving many people I consider to be great friends. I would also like to extend my sincere thanks to all our delivery partners, who contributed so much to our achievements.

The work involved borehole drilling, trial pit excavation, and the collection of groundwater, soil and rock samples.

This work is vital for establishing environmental baseline data for our chosen site and will inform any required land remediation strategies, enable detailed foundation design, and support additional submissions to Redcar & Cleveland Borough Council necessary to discharge two further planning consent conditions.

Charlie Tasker, Programme Director of Green Lithium, said: “The commencement of this activity is a significant landmark in our overall project development programme. It is the result of months of preparation and has involved significant collaboration between our own design team, PD Ports, Sol Environment and Brownfield Solutions to allow rapid mobilisation following the receipt of necessary permissions.”

It was later extended to include our smaller industrial-scale facility on the same PD Ports site on Teesport. The outline approval included various specific conditions, which we are now systematically closing out to reach the construction phase. 
 
Following successful completion of our environmental impact assessment (EIA) during the initial 2023 application, we were set the condition of producing a biodiversity masterplan, focused on the wider ecological considerations of our development in Teesside, UK. Our plan, co-developed with Sol Environment Ltd, includes initiatives towards creating a net positive environmental impact, such as natural water purification through re-bedding techniques and habitat creation in collaboration with a local farm. This biodiversity masterplan was the only condition with a set timeframe and it has now been approved by the council. We are continuing to close out the remaining conditions ahead of construction. 
 
Charlie Tasker, Programme Director of Green Lithium, commented: “We are thrilled to receive this recent confirmation, which brings us one step closer to construction and to realising our vision of a cleaner, more sustainable lithium supply chain. The large-scale refinery will create over 1,000 jobs during the construction phase and provide 250 full-time, highly-skilled positions for local workers once operational.” 
 
“Green Lithium is deeply committed to leading in ESG standards, and this includes significantly reducing the carbon footprint of lithium refining. We will deploy low-energy processes, use renewable electricity and process hydrogen gas once available to achieve a much lower carbon footprint than conventional refineries, setting new benchmarks for sustainability in the industry.”",136,6,8,5mo,Sean Sargent reposted this,Green Lithium,https://www.linkedin.com/company/green-lithium,,2024-11-28T23:36:23.009Z,,,

As Japan has boomed as a destination - from 4.8 million overseas visitors when we started InsideJapan Tours 25 years ago to 36.8 million last year - Overtourism is an issue which has had increasing airtime. 

One pillar of our approach is dispersal of visitors - and doing that by promoting 'under-visited' destinations. We have picked five places in Japan that currently have fewer overseas visitors but have the capacity and desire to have more. 

Pleased to get this page up on our website today about our first of our 'under-visited' destinations, the Toyama area of Japan:

A huge thank you to Thomas Power for organising the sessions, and Exodus, Byway, Felloh | B Corp™, The Thinking Traveller, Sykes Holiday Cottages, TTG Media, Sanderson Phillips | Certified B Corp™, Swoop Adventures, Warwick Events | Certified B Corporation, Selective Asia | B Corp™, HF Holidays, Steppes Travel, Lovat Parks Limited, Sawday's, LEMONGRASS MARKETING LIMITED, Senderos Vitales, ABTOT Limited, Pura Aventura | Travel Positive®, and Wild Dog Design for participating on the day. 

We then opened up beyond B Corp - welcoming travel businesses and journalists from across the South West in an evening orchestrated by James Mundy. The evening networking included insight on Undertourism from our Sustainability Executive, Dom Hughes.

The UK government's push to reduce sugar consumption is evolving, with talks of extending the Soft Drinks Industry Levy (SDIL) to cover milk-based drinks like flavoured milkshakes and lattes.

While this poses challenges for brands relying on sweetness for appeal, it also opens the door for innovation. Reformulating without compromising on taste or indulgence is key. That’s where Nactarome can help.

With our expertise in natural flavourings, functional ingredients, and clean label solutions, we support brands in:
 -  Reducing sugar while preserving a rich, creamy taste
 -  Enhancing mouthfeel and sweetness perception naturally
 -  Staying compliant without sacrificing consumer appeal

The future of indulgent beverages doesn’t have to be less delicious!

This week we celebrate collectively raising almost £750k for environmental restoration - how amazing is that! So, massive thanks to the many people who have helped make this happen, and if you have a good idea in life, go for it as you might be surprised what happens! We're aiming for £1m by 2026!

At onboard:earth we are celebrating our brilliant community of events, companies and audiences raising over £100,000 for environmental restoration in 2024. This means we have now gathered over £740,000 for environmental restoration projects since the charity was founded by SHAMBALA FESTIVAL LIMITED, Boomtown Festival and @Kendal Calling Festival since 2015! 

This year donations have gone to four awesome projects: 
 
💚 Reforestation in Nicaragua, a PlanVivo verified carbon offset project, which works with smallholder farmers to restore forests in partnership with local communities. 

💚 Tree-planting, forestry protection and the creation of sustainable livelihoods through reforestation schemes in Northern Malawi with Temwa 

💚 Storing and sequestering vast quantities of carbon by protecting threatened rainforests. Safeguarding biodiversity by preserving vital wildlife corridors and funding training for local communities to combat forest fires and unlawful deforestation Rainforest Trust UK

💚 Here in the UK donations will fund a Community Energy Cooperative in Wiltshire for the construction of a rooftop solar array for a local school for students with special educational needs and disabilities, generating low-cost green electricity for the school, funding workshops on keeping warm in winter and using surplus power to fund local wildlife restoration projects. Wiltshire Wildlife Community Energy 

Now we set sights on helping our community raise £1 million for environmental restoration by 2026 and launch new tools to support our members and the industry to measure and reduce travel impacts as a first step >> https://lnkd.in/eRZfFhD4

Vision for Sustainable Events, Julie's Bicycle & Andrew Lansley worked with 10 local authorities, 60 events (with audiences of 2.3m) on a ground-breaking national pilot to establish minimum environmental standards and assessment for outdoor events.

The Green Events Code of Practice (GECOP) national pilot achieved a 60% increase in sustainability measures across the 60 music, sports and community events, proving that local authority-led assessments can drive widespread adoption of sustainability practices.

The project was funded by Arts Council England, EarthPercent and participating local authorities. The project was also supported by Festivalrepublic, SHAMBALA FESTIVAL LIMITED, LAEOG UK, LIVE (Live music Industry Venues and Entertainment) and the 60 participating events. This is sector collaboration in action - everyone working together to create a framework for change. And it's working!

My name is Sunday. I’m a dynamic policy expert with a proven track record in evidence-based advocacy, research & policy engagement, & forging impactful partnerships. With an inquiring mind & the ability to foresee policy, political, & reputational challenges, I excel in driving innovative solutions that lead to sector-wide changes in understanding, attitudes, & practice. 

My presence & published record ensure I am a lightning rod for diverse thoughts from across political divides, with a reputation for rigorous analysis & free thinking. I’m also empathetic, loyal, & quite funny. 

Why am I telling you this? Because exactly 3 years to the day I was welcomed into Wonkhe (my first in-person day doubled as an Xmas party!), I’m saying goodbye. 

Being with a company close to a third of its existence has been quite the journey. What was proposed as a 12-month contract to look at the concept of Belonging turned into a greater adventure - even greater than my already very adventurous previous roles working in strategic delivery on post-covid student engagement & before serving as President of my SU during the height of a pandemic.

From briefing VCs on new regulatory implications to advising cross-party boards on education reform, it’s been a whirlwind. I’m proud to have consistently delivered actionable insights against a backdrop of political turmoil and rapid change (4 prime ministers, 2 governments, & 6 education secretaries!). I’ve established a national sphere of influence across education, medicine, gender-based violence, wellbeing, neurodiversity, accessibility, &  housing - bridging academia & policy to advance stability & integrity in these sectors.

I’m deeply passionate about the role HE plays in shaping society, driving innovation, promoting equality, & expanding opportunity. 

I’m particularly interested in roles that align with my skills in:
- Research, impact, & stakeholder engagement
- Communication and policy analysis
- Policy development and leadership

Where I can:
- Get the right people in the right places to solve the right problems.
- Contribute to policy debate and shape the policy landscape.
- Detect and interpret underlying factors driving patterns in data.
- Identify strategic opportunities—like parliamentary agendas—for academics, researchers, and practitioners to influence decisions and tackle real-world challenges.

What I bring:
- A unique ability to unify diverse perspectives and agendas around shared objectives.
- Strong public speaking, written, and oral communication skills, tailored to diverse audiences.
- A drive to solve global challenges like environmental sustainability, social equity, and technological innovation.
- A deep understanding of UK politics, the policy landscape, and public opinion.
- The gift of thriving in chaos.

This kind of recognition means so much. We won't wallow in it forever, but I take it as an important milestone in the journey of Paraorchestra, one where the classical sector (finally) understands our value in pushing the genre forward. 

From a tiny start-up in 2015 with a small Arts Council England grant to get us going, the momentum we have created continues to amaze me. On paper it's easy to understand but somewhat harder to deliver: we've taken artistic risks that ignore the conventions of classical music; we've put thought and care into shaping ideas that new audiences want; and we've embedded a new and equitable model of practice that creates an ecology for disabled musicians and artists to thrive. 

Thank you to saxophonist and award presenter Jess Gillam, who introduced our win with these words: 

“Paraorchestra should be the Pride of Britain. They are inspirational in their care and creativity putting disabled musicians centre-stage. Those musicians are pioneering how orchestras and audiences interact. They are invigorating concert halls with thrilling experiences. Here’s to Paraorchestra, showing us all a way forward”

And a big thank you to everyone who has messaged since, and to all friends and colleagues that celebrated with our squad of musicians, team members and trustees at the awards last night.

For the last 8 years, we've been monitoring readiness and motivations of UK public towards adopting reuse, refill and return behaviours. Our latest 2025 study is now available — what’s clear is that demand for change is growing louder and more urgent. Here’s what we found:

🌍 8 in 10 of UK public are already taking action to reduce single-use plastics in their weekly shop.
💷72% want to see more reusable, refillable and returnable options where they shop.
🛍️ Shopping patterns are shifting towards reuse at least 1 in 4 respondents say they are regularly purchasing in reusable, refillable or returnable packaging.

Barriers still remain, with half say reuse options simply aren’t available (for the products or brands the purchase), and over half feel confused by the sustainability language used by businesses.

But research shows clear pathways and opportunities for the reuse economy. Where do we begin? Which product categories for reuse are more appealing as a first step? What are the communication initiatives to focus on? Which commercial benefits would help people form new habits for reusables?

Read the full report here: https://lnkd.in/eEsewVMC and get in touch with us if you have any questions!

Curious for more? Get in touch with our team. Let's work together to improve access to reuse, and build a packaging system that works for people and planet.

This exciting move follows a people-powered push led by our friends at Nuud, supported by us here at City to Sea alongside Kids Against Plastic, Common Seas, Plastic Health Council, A Plastic Planet, Everyday Plastic, Plastic Free July, Plastic Soup Foundation and Just One Ocean. Together, we helped launch a 38 Degrees petition that brought thousands of voices together to demand action — and Westminster is finally listening.

The motion, led by Kevin Stewart and backed by a powerful group of cross-party MPs and MSPs, urges the UK Government to act now on growing public health concerns around microplastics in gum. The science is shocking—groundbreaking research from Dr. Cuong Cao and @Udit Pant at Queen's University Belfast has shown that just one piece of plastic gum can release more than 250,000 microplastic particles into the human body. 

We’ve banned plastic straws. We’ve banned plastic vapes. But somehow, plastic gum is still being chewed and chucked, sticking around in our environment and even ending up inside us. It’s time to change that. It’s time to #BanPlasticGum. 

We’re so proud to have played a part in this moment through our partnership with Nuud, and we’ll keep pushing until plastic gum is off the shelves for good. 💪

Ruth B. argued that gender equality is good for growth as higher wages and financial security increases demand for goods  and services.  She cited that £1.5 billion is lost annually because women are not economically active enough, and shared evidence of wage deflation as women enter workforce sectors 🤑 

💰Sarah Coles's talk made me want to sort my finances out and make sure everyone has signed up to the City to Sea pension scheme. She shared that women's money does not work as hard for them as mens', with wage, pension and investment gaps leaving women insecure in later life.  We have at least moved past the 'Dave' gap - there are now more female fund managers than fund managers called Dave...just!  🙌 

And so to the panel - a wealth of expertise and knowledge across public and private sectors. Sarah Crew Chief Constable of Avon & Sommerset Police values unlikely partnerships and listening hard to uncomfortable truths, Emma Louise Wood (nee Zeeman) said that organisations need to change not people and thanks to Rebecca Baldwin-Cantello BEM for reminding us that 'this S*%$ effects everyone', improving equity for one group delivers benefits for others! 🏆 

Finally five sets of five minutes that really mattered! Thanks to Tara Miran, Kyrby Brown, Bianca Jones, Matt Humberstone and Lewis Wedlock for sharing lived experience, personal challenges, triumphs, and the urgent actions businesses must take to create truly inclusive workplaces. ⏰ 

Thanks to Sandra Gordon, Kristal McNamara, Sonia Cohen, Sarah Rice and Lucy Kirmond for putting on such an inspiring intersectional event. Where do we sign?

Our latest monthly Ember electricity data shows that additions in wind and solar as well as gains in hydropower have led to the largest declines in coal generation in two years and the first sustained declines since the Covid-19 pandemic.

☀ Wind and solar power have seen consistent additions over the past three years. Year-on-year, wind and solar have now increased for 29 consecutive months! This has brought China closer to reducing its reliance on fossil fuels in the power sector.

🌊  In July 2024, hydropower rose to a new record high for a single month of 168 TWh – 13% higher than the previous record of 149 TWh set in May 2022. Droughts had led to low output in 2023, masking underlying additions in hydro capacity. 2024 has so far shown improved conditions with the added capacity over the last few years manifesting in new records.

As China moves into a new phase of absolute coal power decline, there is a need for a 'beyond-diversification' strategy. My colleague Muyi Yang wrote about this in a recent report https://lnkd.in/dzyjBCae

In a world obsessed with instant reactions, that pause felt like an eternity. But it taught us a powerful lesson about leadership.

In the rush of daily decision-making, we often think quick answers show confidence. But sometimes, the most impactful leaders are those who take a moment to think.

Here’s what I’ve learned about the power of strategic silence:

Respect: Pausing before responding shows respect for the question and the questioner. It’s about thoughtful communication.

Clarity: A brief moment of reflection allows you to align your response with your vision, not just react. It’s not about speed—it’s about accuracy and purpose.

Cultural Impact: In a remote team, every word matters. Strategic pauses in communication set the tone for your culture.

At Athyna, we’ve seen the impact of thoughtful pauses in our meetings, decisions, and team interactions. They give us the space to be clear, intentional, and aligned.

Next time you're in a high-stakes meeting or facing a tough question, take five seconds to think. You’ll be surprised at how much better your response can be.

Leadership isn’t about filling silence. It’s about making every word count.

Fish in the canals of Utrecht, Netherlands had a major problem. They were getting stuck behind a gate, and then they were getting eaten.

Then, the internet stepped in.

Every early spring, fish like bream, pike, and bass migrate upstream to spawn in shallower waters.

But the Weerdsluis lock—normally opened for boat traffic—stays mostly shut during this season. With few ships moving through, the lock doesn’t open often. So the fish pile up, waiting. And predators know exactly where to find them.

The solution? A doorbell. For fish.

City ecologists and developers created the “Fish Doorbell” (Visdeurbel): an underwater livestream aimed at the lock gate, open to anyone online. 

When a viewer spots a fish, they press a digital button. That signal goes to lock operators, who then open the gate and let the fish continue their journey.

It’s crowdsourced conservation—powered by curiosity, empathy, and Wi-Fi.

Since launching, the Fish Doorbell has gone viral. Millions of people from around the world have played digital crossing guard, helping restore a natural migration path that human infrastructure blocked.

No committees. No consultants. Just a clever fix and a shared instinct to help.

Feel free to help the fish yourself at visdeurbel (dot) nl.

✨ 3 spots left — The Four Day Facilitator Certification Training starts May 19

A deep dive into #RelationalPresence— the art of being fully here, with yourself and others.

This training is for those ready to go beyond techniques — and step into embodied facilitation. It’s where communication becomes a path of awareness, and your presence becomes your most powerful tool.

Being a Facilitator of Relational Presence means creating a space where people feel safe to slow down, speak their truth, and truly be heard. 
Where listening becomes a full-bodied experience — and mutual understanding can emerge. 
It’s about helping others explore both courage and openness: to express what’s alive in them, and to receive what’s alive in others.

This is where real transformation happens. 
Not just learning about Relational Presence — but experiencing it, and allowing it to deepen within you.

This years edition (once a year in Europe)
Location: Puurs, Belgium (between Brussels & Antwerp) 
Dates: 2025, May 19–22

If you feel a ‘yes’ - trust it :)

Afterwards I was left standing alone for 30 MINUTES after hitting the
EMERGENCY button FOUR TIMES at a Help Point at one of London's busiest hubs - Oxford Circus.

No one answered the intercom. No one attended in person.

And this one still cuts deep...No commuters checked on me - even as I sobbed. 

Shock turned to angry disbelief: how could such a DIRE failure of our emergency protocols happen in our capital?

I raised the 'alarm' with an open letter to Sadiq Khan, demanding a test of all Help Points and a safety message directing commuters to the ticket hall if the intercom isn’t answered.

I asked you to make as much noise as possible and WOW did you show up. 2.1 MILLION IMPRESSIONS 🤯 

Over TWO THOUSAND SHARES. And hundreds of you writing to offer
words of comfort, share your own experiences and to say you would have stepped in.

Within hours, my inbox filled with journalists -the Telegraph, Evening Standard, The Times, ITV, Jeremy Vine, and more. 

Reliving the attack for interviews has been traumatic, but I knew it was crucial to raise such a shocking failing of our emergency systems.

Last week, I sat down with TFL's Director of Security and Policing, a Superintendent from British Transport Police and the Deputy Mayor of Transport for London...

And walked away with COMMITMENTS - action in weeks or months, not years 💪 

Here’s what was achieved: 

Emergency Guidance Stickers
TfL will explore placing stickers on Help Points listing '999' and the BTP number, and advising passengers to proceed to the ticket hall if help isn’t immediate. 

I was funnelled to an intercom that failed, visible guidance on what to do in that situation could save lives and stop hesitation.

Bystander Campaign Review:
TfL will review their campaign to stress how crucial it is for bystanders to step in. 

A simple “are you ok?” can be LIFE CHANGING for a victim and their recovery. I've offered expertise to make current campaigns more impactful.

Technical System Review:
TfL has agreed to stress-test systems to ensure they work with multiple emergencies happening at once. 

AND clarify audio recording protocols - vital for capturing evidence for the BTP since CCTV doesn’t capture sound.

Balancing this campaign with the launch of my careers platform has been TOUGH. Up at 6am each day...the high cortisol of live TV and other media meant struggling to sleep before 1am. 

But I couldn't just stand by and do nothing...

I share this update with immense pride in advocating for us Londoners ❤️ To all victims, you are incredibly brave. Your voice MATTERS.

Of course, this is just the BEGINNING. And I'm here for however long it takes to see this through. 

My heart overflows with gratitude for all that gave a DAMN, and I urge you once again to repost and share OUR remarkable achievement (I couldn't have done it without you) - so the world knows that real action is underway ✊

Highlighting this as part of #ArtofYouthWork :)

🌟In 2024, we invited nearly 2,000 young people to take part in creative activities
🌟82% of our young people reached at least two of their personal goals through creative work
🌟Our study found that adding creative activities boosted self-confidence and improved personal communication compared to youth work with no creative activities

Isn't that amazing?!

·      There has been a drastic shift in terms of workforce experiences and skillsets over recent years. The numbers of Officers/Staff that are new in service is ever increasing and developing the right career pathway and internal movement processes (the cycling of CID/ARG/Proactive team recruitment from frontline) is more important than ever. 

·      Crime and interventions can now be costed, in both hard £, but also community impact. It isn’t just about aligning Officers/Staff to crime volumes anymore, investing and deploying specific interventions can reduce operating costs and demand, which not only protects victims, but saves £. 

·      New skills are needed, including digital, AI, investigation, but also crucially around business management. Command areas have to create target operating models that closer reflect business models in order to be efficient. 

SO WHAT help is out there and how can Forces start?

Forces can adopt an evidenced based, tool box approach to workforce planning and should start by:

1.     Creating and deploying a strategy that connects future planning with operational activities. Use this strategy to structure a Gold, Silver, Bronze approach to implement and evaluate.

2.     Using models and toolkits (such as succession and movement models, vacancy calculators, cost analysis, role profile aggregators) to target critical areas of the workforce and processes. Good models and toolkits will save £!

3.     Evaluating commissions and embedding evaluators from the start will provide an evidence base as to what plans, changes are working.

When your workforce makes up 80-90% of your assets, you cannot afford to not plan! There are tools and services available now that can save £m in operating costs and deliver a better service.

It is increasing challenges for glass processors globally.
For this reason, Glaston is strongly focusing on developing process- and factory automation aiding our customers to achieve their production goals of predictable production and stabile quality even without any experienced operators to control the process.

Tryba Industrie in France was the 1st one to get our upgrade of Autopilot technology and service agreement for their FC Series furnace in August 2023.

Feedback from Tryba after 6months of operation shows, that Autopilot has proven to fulfill the demanding goals.
“
My general thoughts are quite simple :
Due to increased energy price, we are working night shift only with completely new operators (nothing to do with glass before coming to work for me in October).
They have been operating the furnace alone every night from November with minimal training.
With Autopilot they don’t need to care about the process settings.
No problem with quality or productivity.
 
I couldn’t be happier with the results.

The team had an incredible time at The BFA 2024 Annual Conference yesterday coming together with franchisors, franchisees and industry leaders from across the UK to discuss innovation and how we drive British franchising forwards. 

This conference provides us with the amazing opportunity to network with the best in the franchise industry, listening to insightful talks and taking part in breakout sessions on digital, customer, people, and process innovation.

This year we had the pleasure of listening to our founder and BFA Chair Paul Thompson speak about his wealth of expertise in franchising having been at the helm of Water Babies for over 20 years before recently hanging up his trunks and passing the goggles to new owners.

It’s been an incredible day of insights and networking, and a fantastic evening celebrating excellence in UK franchising. Here’s to an inspiring event for all involved! 💙🧡

As the world's largest baby and toddler swimming school, we are very excited to announce we've been acquired by Elmsley Capital and Westerly Group as we look toward building on our success in the UK and existing international markets. 

After 22 swimcredible years, our founder Paul Thompson is hanging up his trunks and passing the goggles to new owners but he will remain a part of the Water Babies family as a Non-Executive Board Director.

“There are many mixed emotions when selling the business you founded 22 years ago, but the overriding feeling is one of great excitement for the next chapter of Water Babies. It has a fabulous team, from top to bottom and a very special culture and it is now time for the next generation to shine with the excellent support of Ross and Brian; we could not have found better custodians.” - Paul Thompson

Since our inception, Water Babies has grown into the world’s largest baby swim school, today teaching more than 80,000 babies every year through a network of family run franchise businesses across the UK, Ireland, Canada, The Netherlands, China and the USA. Winning numerous consumer awards and establishing partnerships with bodies such as Swim England and the Royal Lifesaving Society, we've worked hard to become widely regarded as the leading authority on baby swimming in the UK. Our new owners recognise the amazing work put in by all of our staff and franchisees and we'll continue with our well-loved business as usual in the UK and Internationally.

As a business we're so proud of the work we've put in and the progress we've made, and we can't wait to keep getting better and better. You can read our full press release through the link below ⬇️

What an incredible couple of days at our home, Winslade Park, celebrating an amazing year and reflecting on our successes and achievements as a global franchise business. Being able to welcome our franchisees from around the world together is the highlight of our year, and what a conference it's been!
 
We reflected on the incredible work from the last 12 months, as well as looking forward to new, collaborative, and exciting projects to keep pushing Water Babies forward as the world leader in baby and toddler swimming.
 
We welcomed the brilliant Peter Cross as our keynote speaker, who sparked meaningful discussions about the power of customer service, and how we can be the gold standard within our industry and beyond.
 
We were also delighted to be joined by our friends at Tommy's, who shared the incredible impact our Splashathon fundraising has on their mission to save babies lives. This was brought home even more as we had the honour of listening to two inspiring mums and Water Babies customers, Vikki and Amie, who bravely shared their real experiences of baby loss and the vital support they received. 
 
Our charity, the Children's Alliance, shared its powerful work to create better starts and brighter futures for children across the UK, having impacted 3,107 children's lives and supported 9 projects. This includes developing an inclusive swimming programme with Access Sport. Ben Humphrey from Access Sport explained how the programme enables disabled children to learn a skill for life in a safe and supportive environment.
 
It was an incredible couple of days, all finished off with a bit of Water Babies fun at our 'Top of the Pops' themed party! 🕺
 
Thank to everyone who made this year's conference one of our best. See you next year! 🥂

Join the conversation and help drive meaningful change. It's time we created more noise about this.

At Centek, we test to real-world conditions to ensure accurate, dependable results. Our stop collars are tested on both soft and hard casing, and we consider a failure the moment slippage begins—not after the API’s allowed 4"" distance.

Why does this matter? When testing on soft casing, set screws can dig in and drag, causing casing material to build up under the collar. This artificially increases holding force, leading to misleading results—especially if you're using harder casing in the field.

If you're relying on test data, check how holding force is measured. Does your supplier report the true slip point, or do they use the API allowance?

For more details, contact sales@centekgroup.com.

Stop collars may be small, but their impact on well integrity is anything but. When a stop collar fails, it can lead to centralizer movement, poor cementing, and even wellbore instability—causing costly delays and potential safety risks.

Common Causes of Stop Collar Failure:

❌ Insufficient Holding Force – If the stop collar slips, centralizers can shift, leading to improper standoff.
❌ Poor Installation – Incorrect placement or inadequate torque can weaken the grip.
❌ Low-Quality Materials – Inferior stop collars may not withstand high downhole pressures and temperatures.
❌ Inadequate Testing – Without rigorous testing, failures can occur unexpectedly in challenging well conditions.

At Centek, we take stop collar performance seriously. Our solutions are tested to extreme conditions to ensure maximum holding force and reliability—because when failure isn’t an option, quality matters. https://zurl.co/HsocB

But these projects come with unique challenges—from navigating casing windows to managing torque, drag, and cementing complexities.

Choosing the right centralization strategy is critical. Bow spring #centralizers, like the Centek S2, are designed for irregular wellbores, ensuring smooth casing deployment and optimal cement placement. A  re-entry project in Ecuador proved their effectiveness—delivering cost savings of up to $250,000 and securing well integrity.

Operators looking for a cost-effective alternative to centralizer subs now have a proven solution. Centek’s TUR-CT, UROS, and UROS-CT close tolerance #centralizers can deliver the same well integrity benefits —but with lower costs, faster lead times, and greater installation flexibility. ✅

🔹 Reduce material and manufacturing expenses
🔹 Avoid long custom build lead times
🔹 Install on-site with greater adaptability

Real-world success in the North Sea proves these centralizers can perform like traditional subs in challenging wells. Why pay more? Get the job done efficiently and economically.

Their ChemoHero packages have been thoughtfully put together by the nurses, with each item targeted at easing a specific side effect from these treatments.

From puzzle books to pass the time during therapy sessions and soothing skin balms, through to stress-calming roller balls and protein/chocolate bars for a little energy boost, each item in their ChemoHero boxes has been thoughtfully put together with the patients care very much at the forefront of their mind.

Some of our lovely Gems went along today to support their wonderful volunteers to help package up 120 boxes, 100 of which will have been given out within this next month. Quite a staggering thought. Their ChemoHero boxes bring so much joy to their patients with each box carefully packaged with tissue paper and labels, signed by the person that packed them, to help create that more personalised, caring feel. 

Cornish Gems donated access to their special healing sounds and breathing techniques via QR code.  This helps specifically to reduce stress cortisol levels by tapping into your nervous system. This can be used by all patients and their families by simply scanning the code and listening! 

This truly is, a wonderful and caring charity and we were honored to have been a part of it today. 

For anyone wishing to donate to help keep these boxes going, you can do so here:

Sharper, bolder, cleaner. And more distinctive, more in keeping with the bold new ambitions we have for the Conference, the Awards and the Dinners.

Our thanks to Mytton Williams for our new identity. 

We’re proud to introduce our new brand. How does it reflect us? Well, the full O in the compressed font represents entrepreneurial thinkers. A character making space for itself. It will animate, adapt, spark and combine.

We’re fortunate to live in one of the world’s most dynamic regions. With our Conferences, Awards and Dinners, EntreConf aims to provide a place for entrepreneurial thinkers to share ideas, make connections and hear the latest thinking. 

Our new brand reflects what EntreConf has always been about — different thinking, ambitious people and a community shaped by possibility. 

The future really is unwritten…

EntreConf will be returning to the Watershed 18 - 19 June. Make sure you are following for the latest updates and speaker announcements.

Some of the highlights: 

⬆️ The promotion of our incredible commercial director Pat White to increase his remit and strategic input across all our products and team. Very happy for Pat and everyone who gets to work with him internally and externally.

Hand-poured. Flame-grilled. 100% ridiculous.
Buy it now for just £10 at: https://lnkd.in/e36tAxvS.

Introducing the candle you didn’t know you needed (and definitely didn’t ask for). Infused with the smoky scent of dry-aged perfection, this artisanal wax blend is our proudest (and most pointless) creation yet. Designed for the devoted carnivore, the steak-scented sensualist, and the aromatherapy renegade, it’s a flickering tribute to flame-grilled fantasy.

Crafted using our proprietary “Smokehouse Essence No.1”, each candle is lovingly hand-poured and imbued with the unmistakable aroma of a 42-day dry-aged ribeye mid-sizzle. It opens with top notes of cracked black pepper and seared crust, followed by a heart of juicy pink centre and buttery marbling. The base notes? Oak smoke, a whisper of rosemary, and just the faintest hint of charred cast iron. Close your eyes and you’re back in the steakhouse — minus the chewing.

At Cow & Sow, we don’t just serve steak — we celebrate it. So when someone in the office joked that “our ribeye smells better than my Jo Malone,” we knew we had to act. After three months, seventeen ruined slow cookers, and one HR complaint, the Grilled Steak Candle was born. A scent so rich, so evocative, so entirely unnecessary — we just had to bottle it (or jar it, technically).

Light it during dinner to enhance your appetite. Use it to relive your last date night at Cow & Sow. Or simply enjoy it while soaking in a hot bath with a glass of Malbec and a side of imaginary mashed potatoes. Warning: May cause spontaneous hunger, fridge raids, and impromptu BBQs in winter.

Perfect For:

✅ The foodie who has everything
✅ The steak-lover who doesn’t care for subtlety
✅ The vegan friend you want to annoy (please don’t actually)
✅ Home scent collectors with a dark sense of humour

The Grilled Steak Candle comes in a matte black glass jar, elegantly embossed with our signature bull insignia and sealed with a custom wax stamp (fitting, right?). It’s packaged in a Cow & Sow butcher-style presentation box, complete with faux grease stains, a mock nutritional label, and an utterly unnecessary recipe card for “Candle-Braised Short Rib.”
Made in Bristol by confused artisans

Being good at your job sometimes backfires.

You get more work, more responsibilities, but not necessarily more pay.

You get trapped in the 'performance punishment' trap.

Here's how it works:

↳ You exceed expectations
↳ Your boss gives you more work
↳ You complete it on time
↳ They think you can handle even more work
↳ You complete it on time
↳ Repeat (until you're burnt out)

The end result is you're overworked and underpaid.

Your work output slows down.

Your happiness at work decreases.

Your quality of life suffers.

So, how do you avoid 'performance punishment?'

1. Communicate your boundaries
2. Be upfront about your pay expectations
3. Negotiate workloads
4. Ask for support when necessary
5. Prioritize self-care
6. Know when to say ""no""

While it can be tempting to say ""yes"" to every task, it's important to consider the impact it will have on your overall performance.

Saying ""no"" can actually improve your reputation and effectiveness.

Remember, it's not always about doing more.

It's about doing things the right way.

Focus on quality, effectiveness, and results.

Say ""no"" to unnecessary work.

Advocate for yourself.

And always prioritize self-care.

The report highlights that glacial melt has increased sea levels by 18mm, when every centimetre of sea level rise exposes another 2mn people to annual flooding somewhere on our planet.

Andrew Fisher, Chairman of Ashfield Land, said: “We set up Ashfield Land in 1990 to offer something different into the real estate market and I’ve been proud to lead the business for the last 35 years. Now it’s time for a refresh and it’s exciting to see Steven McGarva and Ben Holmes stepping forward as our new managing directors across the North and South respectively, working in our leadership group with Claire Cope and Paul Jagroop and sustaining the breadth and depth of experience that makes Ashfield Land unique. This is an evolution move and a continuity play for the business – we know what we want to be, do, and offer our partners and collaborators in the market. We’re excited for the future with our re-shaped leadership team.”

Steven McGarva, Managing Director North at Ashfield Land, said: “Refreshing our leadership team while continuing our ethos for dynamic, strategic decision-making is the right thing for the business to do. Andrew has done a fantastic job leading our business and I’m excited and looking forward to continuing to work with him, Ben and the wider leadership team in the new Managing Director North role.”

Ben Holmes, Managing Director South at Ashfield Land, said: “I joined Ashfield Land because I could see both an exceptional track record and an exciting future for the business. I’m pleased to be part of this future and shaping it more directly as Managing Director South. Ashfield Land is all about delivery and I’m looking forward to continuing that track record and to more excellent results.”

The changes are effective from today (1 May 2025).

Ashfield Land invested over £2 million to deliver the new PureGym building, working with local contractor, CM Steel Buildings Ltd, who led construction of the 12,500 sq ft building.

The new gym will add to the mix of leisure facilities at Two74 alongside Scotland’s first Topgolf facility, which has been a successful addition to the local area since opening in December 2022.

Declan O’Neill, Associate at Ashfield Land, said: “PureGym is an excellent addition to our Two74 development in Rutherglen and strengthens the leisure offering alongside Topgolf. We worked with a local supply chain to deliver the building and EV charging, supporting local jobs and delivering a range of economic benefits. It’s been a pleasure working with PureGym and our construction team and we look forward to seeing the facility flourish.”

Our wider design team included Cooper Cromar, DSSR, WRD engineer and Currie & Brown.

Is this finally about to change? For a city already witnessing a huge boom over the last few years, could sport finally be about to challenge, and boost the creative and culture of the city and bring in a potential £100m+ into the economy? 

A huge, and often dramatic couple of weeks in the football world starts on Thursday, at Ashton Gate, and it could be huge for Bristol!

Where does the time go, we wonder?

As much as we love the weekend, I say: do something fun and fulfilling so the days, weeks, and years don’t start to just roll into one. Challenge yourself this weekend to spend an hour doing something outside your comfort zone. Live a little on the wild side—or at least a different side.

Can you do something that will teach you something new? I’m not quite sure where I’d start, but I’m thinking about what would pique my interest. It could be listening to a new podcast, visiting a new area, grabbing a coffee in a local café and striking up a conversation with a local resident... who knows?

Which brings me to my question: how often do we truly experience something new? Something where we pause and say, “Ah, I’ve never done that before,” or, “Wow, I didn’t know that.”

But the reality is, it comes with significant responsibilities. You can’t run a business without a team, and with a team comes people management. Balancing staff needs alongside the requirements of the organisation is a true juggling act.

Whether you are one year in or ten years in, the journey is about learning and building character. If we aspire to be among the high achievers making a huge impact and disrupting industries, we must first master management and leadership at a smaller level on the way up.

Every day, I am thankful because I am in my dream job. This is a reminder that you don’t have to be perfect, but you must learn from mistakes and aim to get 1% better with each step. Always do your best!

We believe we are the first indoor leisure sites to have them. They sit alongside our defibrillators and first aid kits to ensure that we are able to respond as robustly as possible in the event of a first aid emergency.

It has been nearly two years since we first reached out to Kitt Medical's James Cohen and I have been constantly in awe of the work they are doing. 

They originally started in schools but have now expanded out into wider businesses. Our Teams calls changed backdrop as they moved from shared office space into their own offices along the way, but their passion and drive to make anaphylaxis Kitts as common as defibrillators did not change.

I’m incredibly proud of our teams for the resilience and agility they have shown this weekend across our leisure sites. At each site we’ve needed to fundamentally change our Christmas experience due to Storm Darragh. 

That has meant working late into the night to rapidly deconstruct our grottos outside and reconstructing them indoors as well as creating a brand new entrance for our Weston-super-Mare seafront site on their opening day for the Christmas experience. It has also meant a lot of work to keep guests updated as we cancelled the first session of the day across all of our sites whilst the red warning was still in place.

Throw in a few other challenges like the triple whammy of our booking system, internet and phone lines going down this morning and it has been a real day of challenges. Even just getting to work today has not been without its problems, but they all have. 

Our laser-tight focus on guest experience is what drives our teams. Giving families the best Christmas experiences has been at the forefront of their minds these past 24 hours.

It is our busiest month of the year as our Christmas experiences see some 15,000 people through come through the doors. Our customer reviews are some of the highest in the country for similar experiences. This is all down to the fantastic people I am lucky enough to call colleagues.

I reflected on all of this as I stood on Weston-super-Mare seafront at lunchtime directing families to our newly created entrance (hence the picture). 

I am proud to say to colleagues that I have done every single role in the organisation as we’ve grown the business and I wasn’t going to let the hastily created role of ‘customer signposter’ detract from that statement!

A big thank you to all our team who have definitely gone the extra mile this weekend!",125,15,2,5mo,Post,Tom Filer,https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-filer-3b86915a,,2024-12-07T13:54:36.377Z,,,

The transition to renewable energy is a global priority, but recent investigations reveal a troubling ethical concern. According to The i Paper, solar panels installed at major UK sites — including Manchester City Football Club Women’s Stadium and David Lloyd Clubs — may have links to forced labour in China. 

A critical component of these panels, polysilicon, has been traced to production facilities in Xinjiang, China, where the Uyghur minority has been subjected to forced labour. While there is no suggestion that organisations knowingly sourced these panels under such conditions, the findings raise important questions about supply chain transparency and ethical procurement. 

This issue underscores the need for businesses and institutions to conduct rigorous due diligence when adopting green technologies. As sustainability efforts accelerate, it is crucial to ensure that ethical considerations are embedded in procurement decisions.

Starbucks is under fire following a lawsuit in Brazil alleging slavery-like conditions on coffee farms linked to its supply chain—farms that had already been flagged for labour violations.

Despite existing ethical sourcing protocols like Starbucks' C.A.F.E. Practices, serious questions remain:

🔍 Are voluntary standards enough?
⚠️ Where does accountability truly lie?
📊 How robust is ESG reporting without third-party verification and enforcement? Why not use MillionMakers™?

This is not just about Starbucks. It’s a systemic issue that spans global supply chains—from coffee to cocoa, fashion to fisheries.

📌 Business leaders take note:

Transparency must be real-time and data-driven.
Human rights due diligence must be proactive, not reactive.
Reputational risk is now intrinsically linked to supply chain ethics.

Ethical sourcing isn’t a sustainability add-on—it’s a governance issue, a legal risk, and a boardroom responsibility.

One minute I’m negotiating with a 2-year-old over socks. The next, I’m finalising contracts with consultants. 
 
Running a business while raising little ones (mine are 2 and 4) means switching hats fast. 
 
But truth is—they’re the same skills: 

- Crisis management (tantrums or client fire?) 
- Time blocking (nap time = power hour) 
- Negotiation (a 4-year-old is tougher than any contract!) 
 
To every parent juggling it all—you’re doing amazing.

What an absolutely amazing day we had planting a microforest with the incredible kids in Plymouth! The sun was shining, the energy was high, and we all got our hands dirty for a great cause with SocieTree .

From digging and planting to learning about nature, it was a full day of teamwork, laughter, and fresh air. The kids were fantastic—so curious, so engaged, and so excited to be part of something that will grow for years to come.

Huge thanks to Steve Warren-Brown and Bethan Rose for their kindness, effort, and generosity— I really learnt so much! Here’s to more days like this, where we plant, learn, and grow together.

We’ve completed forests 10 and 11 with the fantastic children at Plaistow Hill Infant and Nursery School and Mary Dean's C of E Primary School, and we couldn’t be prouder. Seeing them get stuck in (and a little muddy), learn about tree porridge, and get excited about their new micro forests has been amazing.  Together, we've planted over 1000 trees in the grounds of these 2 primary schools. 

And there’s even more good news… we've welcomed our first education sponsor! Huge thanks to Porteous Groundworks Ltd for supporting Mary Dean’s ‘My Wacky Forest’ education package, it makes such a difference.

We’d love to see more schools get the same opportunity, so if you know a business looking to support real, hands-on environmental education, send them our way.

Massive thanks to the schools, the teachers, the volunteers, and, of course, the children themselves, you’re all legends. Here’s to the next one (which just happens to be next week)!  Mushi is having a busy month. 

If you love seeing children leading the way for nature, give this a like or get in touch 🌱

Working with the wonderful client team, DesignHawk combined precise messaging with modern and bold design to communicate clearly to the consumer and create a truly differentiated flavour experience.
 
A sprint of a project, including pack design, a photoshoot and shopper marketing, we were able to make this happen in record time. Because great things need to happen quickly.

Two very talented young professionals who have lost their entire household income in one fell swoop.

I don't often write on LinkedIn, but I felt compelled to after helping a prospect last week who had two businesses each with a full suite of Group Protection Insurances (Group Life, Group Income Protection and Group Critical Illness) looked after by a large household name broker. 

This broker charged a fixed fee of over £2,400 (plus VAT) per policy, no matter the size of the plan (some of the premiums were only £1k a year so the broker charge was equivalent to over 150% commission!). All-in-all the client was heading towards a fee bill north of £17k! 

I am delighted to say this 'prospect' is now a happy Excellect client paying a fraction of this by way of a small transparent premium-linked commission paid through their monthly premiums. 

If you are paying your broker a fee for your Group Protection policies please send me a PM, I would be delighted to review this for you.

Lisa Branco, Inside Sales Representative @ MEDDICC, shares what motivated her to choose sales intentionally - and how it’s helped her grow in ways she never expected.

From building confidence with C-suites, to learning to back herself even when it’s uncomfortable, Lisa’s journey is PROOF that growth happens when you push yourself beyond what’s easy.

She also speaks honestly about:

 ✨ Navigating the pressure to prove yourself
 ✨ The power of mentorship and female support networks
 ✨ Why emotional intelligence gives women a unique edge in sales

This is an incredible reminder that the more women show up in this industry, the more we reshape what success looks like.

Thank you, Lisa, for being part of Women in Sales! 💜

You build it by showing up - especially when you don’t feel like it.

Oscar recently lost his placement, (not any fault of his own), and is looking for an employer where he can finish his Level 4 Data Analyst Apprenticeship.

You'll appreciate how hard it is to stand in front of a camera to record any content for LinkedIn, let alone a video where you are asking for work.

Oscar is honestly so talented, he blew us away talking about some of the skills he's already gained in data visualisation, database management etc.

Sabbatical?  Change of career?  Something entirely different? 

Table Top Travels is a brilliant initiative to have come out of the work Alive have done with the University of Bristol as part of the Connecting Through Culture project.

Tabletop Travels is a multi-sensory travel experience in the form of a gift box, co-designed with and for older people who are isolated at home. Recipients have been telling us how the experience has boosted their emotional wellbeing.

There are opportunities to continue beyond the period of this funding. 

To have a chat call Tot Foster on 07973917655.

This is an amazing opportunity that would suit someone looking to do something different, with business and sales experience but wanting to market something that  does help improve people's wellbeing.

And whenever I ask “Why did you choose Cobus?” the answers tend to fall into three categories.

Trust

Clients know we’ll deliver to critical deadlines with cost certainty so we don’t go over budget. Whether it’s a full-scale fit-out or a single-floor refurbishment, they trust us to get it right, because we’ve done it before. 

Simplicity

Our proven four step methodology, means our clients don’t have to juggle contractors, suppliers, and multiple timelines. We give them one team, one point of contact, one seamless process.

Relationships

We take time to understand what each client actually needs. We stay involved, stay accountable, and stay connected, even after the project is complete.

That’s why so many of our clients return for future work. And it’s what we pride ourselves on most.

If you’re considering a workplace project and want a team that keeps things clear, collaborative and under control, we’d be happy to help.",27,0,0,3w,Post,Lloyd Coldrick,https://www.linkedin.com/in/lloyd-coldrick-10a55686,,2025-04-17T10:30:14.459Z,,,

We were briefed to create a high quality, professional working environment, whilst incorporating Cirencester Friendly’s company colours, motives and values. The main challenge was to introduce an open-plan office to those who hadn’t been familiar to this setting before. It was important to accommodate to each department with their specific requirements. By providing regular updates and ensuring consistent communication throughout the project we established a fantastic relationship. There were many aspects to the design in which we worked very closely together and both parties were thrilled with the end result. Watch our new testimonial video, kindly provided by Michelle West-Wiggins about the project and relationship built between the 2 companies. We're happy to see that everyone has settled into the new space!

These are exciting (and challenging) projects, often with very strict deadlines. We need to ensure that these rooms are ready to welcome the students back at the start of the new term, so there is no room for error! High quality, durable products are needed to withstand student life while also acting as a blank canvas for each student to personalise. We're looking forward to another busy 6 weeks with new challenges and, hopefully, some nice new project photos and case studies to share!

This month marks my 10 year work anniversary with The Letting Game! I was just 22 years old when I joined the team as a Tenancy Co-ordinator. Never did I think that I would still be here 10 years later as Managing Director! 

To mark the occasion, I wanted to share 10 things I've learnt during my time with The Letting Game! 

1. Stay in your own lane
There's a great quote by Robin Sharma that says, ""Run your own race. Who cares what others are doing? The only question that matters is: Am I progressing?""  It's very easy to compare ourselves to others. Success comes from persistence and staying true to your own unique path.

2. Honesty is the best policy
Honesty is foundational to building trust. When there's no trust, there are doubts. We're all human, we all make mistakes and it's OK to admit them when we do. 
 
3. Trust your gut
Learning to ""trust my gut"" has been the single, most invaluable lesson - and not just on a professional level.

4. Hard work pays off
To me, hard work means putting in consistent effort, time and energy. It's not about exerting yourself to the point of burn-out (although I've been guilty of this at times!), but more about being intentional and committed to success. 

5. Stay open to learning
Knowledge is power, right?! But no matter how much you know, there is always more we can learn. Every industry evolves and every person we meet, has experiences we can learn from. 

6. Team work really does make the dream work
Once upon a time I thought I could do it all, I was sometimes afraid to let people in but as the business grew, I started to learn the importance of collaboration. Working together leads to higher productivity and better morale!

7. Take time to reflect
I believe this is a skill which is largely underestimated, and only in more recent years have I really understood its value. Creating space to reflect has been one of the most important parts of my professional, and personal development. It's led me to making better decisions, build stronger relationships and lead the business more effectively.

8. Wellness matters
I'm very passionate about this one! Eating well, staying hydrated, moving and getting enough sleep is essential for performance. I've seen the difference in my own performance when I've prioritised these habits. 

9. You don't grow in your comfort zone
My biggest learnings have come from my greatest challenges. I've certainly learnt to embrace the challenges along the way. Through being uncomfortable I've become more resilient which has helped me to adapt to this ever-changing industry and workplace.

10. Don't sweat the small stuff
This is a powerful one, and it's all about prioritisation and perspective. Focussing on the bigger picture has helped me to focus on what truly matters. It's a lesson in resilience and accepting the inevitable - not everything is in our control! #workmilestone",47,9,0,3mo,Post,Samantha Derrett,https://www.linkedin.com/in/samantha-derrett-bbb90778,,2025-01-13T15:54:12.133Z,,,

The jobs I have applied for are not just at my anticipated salary level that I would like, but literally anything to help me pay my monthly bills . 
This is not just via LinkedIn… via lots of different sources. 

For the first time in my life, I can even more so see why some people just can’t cope with this level of stress anxiety and pure desperation. Not only that but also abandonment by people who I thought would help and support me when I supported them in their time of need - you know who you are. 

To meet monthly living costs and just ‘survive’ day to day is now becoming too much for me and I am sure many others feel the same. 

Tears are rolling down my face as I am typing this. I am at a total loss how I can pay my monthly bills and literally keep going. I feel lost and vulnerable and I am not afraid to share that. 

Why is it so hard to get a job? I have so much to offer a company and have worked so hard to get the experience I have gained, I am proud of my accomplishments. 

Please no horrible comments (trust me, I have had my fair share of them). I am just a person who wants a job to get by in life. That is all

As a mutual founded to build a greener society and challenge the norms in financial services, we want to show leadership in our ambitions to reduce our own environmental impact.

And it’s important we’re transparent about our own journey to net zero, so we can share our learnings with our Members and peers.

I hope our Net Zero Transition Plan demonstrates how we continue to live our values and lead by example to show our sector that there can be other ways to do business.

The plan - created by Ecology’s Sustainability Lead, Stephanie Landymore, in partnership with teams across the Society - also illustrates that reaching net zero is not a linear journey.

In 2024, our financed emissions (carbon emissions from the homes we lend on) rose by almost 40% - on numbers alone this looks like bad news. But the rise is explained by the fact that last year we lent to more borrowers with the least energy-efficient properties. 

Ecology mortgages are enabling these Members to bring their homes up to a higher environmental standard, a reminder of the impact our lending can achieve.

While we move with the times and invest in the future of Ecology, this impact-led lending shows why we’re needed today as much as when we were founded back in 1981.

It's not quite the number one spot (unless you're really shit at maths), but considering this is our first year partaking in Great Place To Work UK, we're pretty chuffed that our first attempt has made it into the top 50 across multiple lists. 🏆 

We're humble enough to say that we're currently working on bettering ourselves (which is extremely difficult when you're such an incredible business 🤕 ) so we can secure those higher placements next year and can confidently say if we don't win next time...*

There is no one size, one fix, fits all. 
…………………………
Life may throw curveballs our way. This is out of our control. What is in our control is building a foundation based on resilience and robustness so we can survive the storm. Remember, setbacks are not roadblocks, but rather opportunities for growth and change. The more you learn about yourself and the world around you, the more confident and educated on life you are going to be. 
…………………………
I spent years researching stoicism & Buddhism, the cultural aspects of many countries, various philosophy concepts and religious scripts. I applied what I found useful for me alongside facing my own adversity in a plethora of ways. In doing so I arrived at some understanding of how to overcome adversity. I have come to learn that experience is the coin of the realm and the only knowledge that endures. 
…………………………
After a few decades in the making, I am launching my mentoring services. The Practical Philosopher. It is an opportunity for me to make some meaning from all my challenges by sharing with others how I overcame them. https://lnkd.in/e935F9em 
…………………………
It’s a platform for working with me to help you find your own eco system so you can find more contentment, peace, and acceptance. It will require you to hold your feet to the fire and may get uncomfortable at times. But if you are ready, we can work to create your own peaceful garden.

On Tuesday I was invited to the opening of Phase 2 where I got to see first hand the difference those involved are making to peoples lives. 
Whilst we can be proud of our contribution at NewSpace, the real praise goes to those behind the scenes and especially the volunteers who dedicate their hearts and time to helping others  less fortunate than ourselves, everyday.
I was really humbled by my visit and left with a better appreciation of the root causes of homelessness and that in a cruel twist of events, often outside of our control, anyone could end up homeless. I was surprised to learn that much of the addiction we associate with homelessness is not the root cause and that people develop addictions on the streets to numb the pain of being homeless and the events that led to it, which are often so heartbreaking. I don’t know what I would do if I lost my family, they are my life and my purpose. 
I also came to appreciate that people experiencing homelessness must be some of the most resilient people in our society and it shouldn’t define who they are. 
Surely we can do more to prevent homelessness in the UK and provide a better root out of it. We all need shelter and support from family, friends and community. The Bus Project provides all of that and importantly a second chance. Every city should have the equivalent of The Bus Shelter Project in Dorset.",23,0,1,1mo,Post,Andy Cullimore,https://www.linkedin.com/in/andy-cullimore-a844772a,,2025-03-27T10:54:33.472Z,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7310962975245283328/,blob:https://www.linkedin.com/a3cbf5b4-3443-497b-ad47-b18e9e7e0981,

At Mawdsleys, teamwork is at the heart of everything we do. For our latest quarterly event, the team put their problem-solving skills to the test at an Escape Room challenge—some of us cracked the code, and others were so charming they earned extra time!
We wrapped up the evening with delicious food and plenty of laughs at Cappadocia Turkish-Mediterranean Restaurant. A great night building some memories with the team.

As the CEO it is the one document I read for every single staff member in our organisation. Why is this? It is the voice of the staff member (they write the first section) and provides a real indication of where each of our staff are at and how we are doing as an organisation in relation to them, it sets aspirations for the following year and the commitments we are all making to the organisation and our own development.
 
This didn’t happen overnight we have been building a culture of positivity around appraisals. Spending time in culture conversations understanding the value of appraisals and building trust, to enable the team to feel they can be honest in them. We provide training every year for managers so they understand how to deliver the process, and get the right approach.
 
The question that always comes in these discussions is who is doing your appraisal? The answer is the chair of trustees, his reflections on the last year and his challenges to me on the plans for the future and my areas for development definitely set the tone for success of the charity. Don’t underestimate the value of appraisals that are done well, they are an essential tool!",32,2,0,2w,Post,Tracy Clark,https://www.linkedin.com/in/tracyclark2,,2025-04-28T07:37:46.323Z,,,

I’m incredibly proud to share that I’ve been offered the opportunity to become an EDI Champion alongside my current role as Data Manager at Young Gloucestershire.
Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion isn’t just something I care about professionally—it’s something I’ve lived.
I’ve faced many moments in my journey where I didn’t feel like I belonged. In a previous role, I often felt inadequate because of where I came from—and I now realise I was undervalued and underpaid, taken advantage of because I didn’t have the confidence (or the privilege) to advocate for myself.
One moment I’ll never forget: being told, “You’ve done well, considering where you’ve come from.”
 At the time, I didn’t know what to say. It was deeply hurtful and patronising—and it reinforced the idea that my background made me “less than.” That comment, and many others like it, stuck with me—not because they define me, but because they remind me why this work is so necessary.
Growing up mixed-race in a single-parent household, losing my mother at 16, and fighting for custody of my younger sister while facing food insecurity and systemic barriers shaped who I am. My sister, who is part of the LGBTQ+ community, and my extended family in Gloucester have all experienced exclusion and racial prejudice—and those realities have fuelled my drive to create meaningful change.
As an EDI Champion, I will be committed to building spaces where no one feels small, silenced, or “less than” because of who they are or where they come from. I want to help create environments where every story matters, and every voice is valued.
Thank you to Young Gloucestershire for this opportunity and for recognising the importance of lived experience. This role isn’t just a title—it’s a responsibility I will carry with pride and purpose. 💛

We are extremely proud to have won the Charity of the Year award following our most successful
year of fundraising last year which was also our 30th year. 

Peter Hickman, now in his nineties took on the challenge of fundraising for a new children’s hospital for the County & it opened in 2004. The charity then supported special schools of which there are now 14 in Gloucestershire who need sensory rooms, play areas & vehicles. 

Pied Piper support children’s mental health provisions, wish holidays for children with life limiting illnesses with their families & equipment & nurses training bursaries on the Children’s Unit. 

We couldn’t do this without amazing support from the public & local businesses as well as dedicated Trustees & Volunteers. 

This award goes to everyone involved at Pied Piper 👏👏
